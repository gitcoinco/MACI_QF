More pragmatically speaking, the future vision is that one SymbioTotem can be assembled at each Zuzalu instance, building up from the principles and guidelines that are currently being developed and that will compose a Open Source Toolkit. This way, it can serve as a living symbol of the symbiotic relationship between technology, community, and nature, embodying Zuzalu’s core mission of fostering innovation at the intersection of open technology, science, health, and social innovation. Therefore, it can hopefully:\n\n- Foster environmental stewardship and empathy within the Zuzalu community and the larger web3 ecosystem, catalyzing and leveraging meaningful use of blockchain tech towards conservation and regeneration.\n\n- Educate attendees on local biodiversity and culture through an immersive, interactive platform.\n\n- Encourage the integration of environmental considerations in future Zuzalu events and the broader community, perhaps via the recognition of citizenship to nonhuman entities.",

                '## TL;DR\n\nSymbiocracy aims to integrate non-human voices into governance, leveraging AI and blockchain. The "Rio Sagrado (Sacred River) AI-Avatar", a SymbioTotem multimedia installation, represents this vision by interacting with its environment and the community. Moving into Phase 3, the project will shift from commercial LLM APIs to local LLMs and enable these systems to enter into smart contracts, rewarding sustainable actions with SymbioTokens. This initiative promotes the Rights of Nature and aims for autonomous eco-representatives.\n\n## Introduction\n\nWe at [Sympoiesis](http://sympoiesis.xyz/) understand that the more-than-human complexes that make up life on Earth have valuable contributions to governance related dynamics, even more so in the context of the ongoing climate crisis. That is, other living beings have much to say about the choices we collectively make - especially those that affect multiple lifeforms sharing the same space, even if temporarily. And they do so not just as simple cold data providers but as sentient and conscious members of their communities. The big challenge is that, with modernity, we have lost the habit of naturally perceiving, interacting with, and internalizing their voices.\n\nIn this sense, Symbiocracy represents a deep inquiry towards ways of engaging with the more-than-human pluriverse, in order to propose interfaces that enable sensory-intuitive interactions and interspecific deliberative processes. An inquiry that is ever more practically relevant in light of advances in the Rights of Nature movement, substantiated by attribution of legal personhood and rights to non-human beings in many different countries. Whanganui River and Urewera Forest in Aotearoa New Zealand, and Komi-Memen River in Brazil to name a few.\n\nThe paths for this new kind of engagement with the more-than-human pluriverse can be approached through various forms. At Sympoiesis we are currently exploring how modern science and technology can be a vehicle for such, and thus a medium for the human reconnection with their own nature.\n\n## SymbioTotem and Rio Sagrado AI-Avatar\n\n![avatar_rio-sagrado_profile](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hkv7GHNdA.png)\n(Rio Sagrado AI-vatar physical sculpture meshed with the River\'s waters)\n\n\n\nIn the official first Zuzalu Quadratic funding round we presented the [SymbioTotem](https://checker.gitcoin.co/public/project/show/symbiototem-by-sympoiesis) concept: "a multimedia art/science installation designed to engage communities and facilitate interspecies interaction by interpreting and presenting local ecological data in a relatable manner." Since then, **the "[Rio Sagrado AI-Avatar](https://kumu.io/emergir/sympoiesis#website/avatar-rio-sagrado)" has been the primary proof-of-concept for the SymbioTotem**. Rooted in Zuzalu Montenegro, this political AI-vatar has been the test-ground for the consolidation of the technologies and community practices most appropriate to bootstrap such systems. And thanks to the financial support from the Zuzalu community we have been able to continue developing the project, which is currently on Phase 2 (Beta), featuring:\n\n- Continuous community engagement around the cultural and legal recognition of the River as an entity of right.\n- A LLM model instructed to represent the river informed by 30+ articles on the river watershed and dedicated sensors for live environmental monitoring. Accessed via:\n  - [Webpage interface](http://sympoiesis.xyz/rio-sagrado/)\n  - WhatsApp interface (+554196638496)\n  - Voice based in site interface via a physical sculpture (crafted by a native artist), that highlights the river\'s biodiversity and hosts the embedded computer system for the AI-vatar.\n\n![AI-vatar Pi copy](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkCoSB4dA.png)\n\nWith its modular and open-sourced codebase, the Rio Sagrado AI-vatar\'s backbone can be easily adapted to other implementations. In fact, conversations have started towards other applications for rivers in Brazil and Aotearoa New Zealand. At the same time, we are especially eager to the moment in which we will be able to deploy such tech at a Zuzalu event, materializing our vision for the SymbioTotems to "encourage the integration of environmental considerations in future Zuzalu events and the broader community, perhaps via the granting of citizenship status to nonhuman entities."\n\n## Towards Symbiocracy\n\nWith the ongoing Phase 2 (Beta) deployment of the Rio Sagrado AI-vatar/SymbioTotem we are drafting next steps for Phase 3, whose intent is twofold:\n- Move away from API-based (especially commercial) LLM services towards local LLM approaches;\n- Enable such systems to enter into contracts with the community (both local and global), in benefit of the source entity(ies) they represent. These contracts would be intermediated through the "SymbioToken" - a name agnostic on-chain currency incentivizing ecological preservation and community engagement by rewarding participants for sustainable practices and contributions to environmental projects.\n\nOur infrastructural blueprint for this new phase is the following:\n\n![Avatar Phase 3](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Bk4EUrNOA.jpg)\n\n\nAt a local (in-machine) level, The Rio Sagrado AI-vatar/SymbioTotem system would:\n- Store data (lists) for: 1) Community crowdsourced bounties in benefit of the River (e.g. cleanups and tree planting), with ideas gathered through the avatar interface itself; 2) Verified web3 wallet addresses of "River Guardians" - users who care about the River and have been onboarded into the project; 3) A history with past completed bounties. \n- Maintain a balance/accounting sheet with existing resources in Funds Basket for the Avatar\n- \nAt the Blockchain level, the system would:\n\n- Have a Smart Contract that both issues SymbioTokens (collateralized by Funds Basket) and distributes them to contributors\'s wallets as triggered by sensor related events. For this, our ongoing research is leading us towards the use of the Celo chain (due to value\'s alignment around Re-fi principles - and the existing [MiniPay](https://docs.celo.org/developer/build-on-minipay/overview) app infrastructure).\n\n- Have a Dapp interface through which "River Guardians" could check their balances, transact tokens to each other, withdraw to fiat, etc. For the development of both the smart contracts and the Dapp itself, we are considering the use of [Moralis](https://moralis.io/build/)\' tech stack.\n\nWith all of this setup, we hope to develop a protocol for enabling on chain AI-vatars/SymbioTotems to perform autonomous information request<>action<>assessment event cycles on land, (or “autonomous action-inquiry”) as representations of the ecosystems\' through which they are connected to.\n\n## Zuzalu Q2 Funding\n\nAny funding we receive through the Zuzalu Q2 round will be used towards R&D for Phase3, especially what concerns blockchain technologies, like the development of the SymbioToken Smart Contract and associated Dapp.',

                "Ixian is the world's first proper legal engineering law firm. That's because, despite software eating the world and so products are eating services, lawyers in almost every jurisdiction in the world cannot properly perform 21st century lawyering, which we're calling legal engineering because it's so foreign to 20th century or earlier lawyering. \n\nIn part because our firm can only operate 21st century law out of a free jurisdiction, we're specializing in what we're coining 'sovereigntech' for free jurisdictions and web3.  \n\nFirst on our list is ZuKernel. Ulex https://www.decentralizedgovernance.institute/ulex is a great idea, but we should develop a \"ZuKernel\" that prioritizes permissionless anonymity and other web3 requirements compared to other configs.\n\nWe're already starting to work with https://coordination.network to analyze the https://prospera.co version of the kernel, so we can deconstruct an applied version of it. But we anticipate a proper analysis will cost a lot of resources. If we want to create a ZuKernel, then we'll have to use a substantial amount of resources. Part of the analysis will decide what parts of the kernel are latency-deterministic enough to become web3 protocols, to become trustless.\n\nBeyond the kernel project, our firm believes that law is a public good and that it should be as open sourced as code. That means most of our services-become-products legal work will likely have to be open source if they're to remain ethical, and in the long-run we would like to establish a way to avoid tragedy of the commons via a Zuzalu established public goods flywheel.\n\nA lot of our public goods work is done through the https://doc.lex.clinic charitable organization, currently transitioning from alpha to beta stage. For instance, the Clinic is managing the Journal of Legal Engineering where we're working with https://coordination.network to sensemake the transcripts in the legal engineering conferences we run so that journal authors can quickly turnaround frontier sovereigntech law. \n\nOur next legal engineering conferences are:\n\n* ZuVillage Georgia Legal Engineering week August 7 to 11\n* MCON Detroit DUNA Day official side event September 26 to 28\n* Vitalia Safe Harbor Summit Roatan November 22 to 24 \n\nRegardless if we're the right fit, Zuzalu should prioritize law is a public good funding! Especially since more and more law is being done directly onchain via projects like https://nani.ooo . ",

                  "# II. Our Goals \n\nOur vision is to build a breath ecology by incentivizing real-world activities that improve breathability, such as enhancing biodiversity, improving air quality, and reducing CO2 emissions. Currently, traditional markets and price mechanisms fail to value such crucial impact work. To change this, we need a new social and tech architecture that creates environmental and economic value for all stakeholders through collective care work.\nIn the first stage of our project, we used art to introduce blockchain-based tools and raise awareness about the precarious nature of our breaths and the individual agency each person holds in creating a healthier atmosphere. Building on this foundation, the second \n stage, for which we seek support and funding, aims to create the architecture to measure and protect a community-driven right to breathe, empowering individuals and communities to take meaningful real-world action.\n \n# III. Existing Software/Hardware Foundations (Stage 1)\n\nWith deRtB, we launched “A Thousand Breaths” (ATB), an NFT collection developed by a diverse team of web3 developers, legal experts, computer scientists, social justice advocates, and digital artists. ATB offered a decentralized breathing rights experience, inviting people to embody the experience and share it with the world. Check out our codebase.\n\nEach minted artwork is produced directly by the user’s breath, as captured by a custom-designed and fabricated breathing device, and which is then processed and digitally rendered in the collection. These artworks are used to raise awareness of differences in breathing conditions from place to place (and person to person), collect actionable data for local communities, and expand its online community of users who can further share and advocate for breathing rights.\n\nWe’ve since developed and deployed two prototypes (see detailed descriptions below) in various spaces, including SXSW, art festivals, and Zanzalu. \n\n**The NFT collection** is minted on the Ethereum mainnet, with all income reinvested into advancing the project's goals.\n\n**BreathTaking Device v1 (LoPh, Austria)** was custom built and 3D printed by a team of electrical engineers and hardware designers, Infineon-trained, in Carinthia (Austria). The device sensors measure live breathing and atmospheric data (CO2, O2, ethanol, temperature, humidity, time, location) through an in-built raspberry pi 3+ interface activated by a user’s RFID card, and transmitted wirelessly for image processing and on-chain deployment.\n\n**BreathTaking Device v2 (MCS Data Labs, Germany)** features an array of 14 gas sensors embedded in a versatile, modular design for future enhancements. It includes high-efficiency, low-noise PWM fans by Noctua for optimal airflow and chamber cleansing, MQ-X series and MICS gas sensors, and Bosch BME688 sensor arrays. The device measures volatile organic compounds (VOCs), CO2, eCO2, and indoor air quality (IAQ). The AI-powered digital nose functionality enhances detection of specific odors and conditions, including smoking, dry mouth, and elevated acetone levels. Seamless connectivity for mobile devices and blockchain integration is achieved with bluetooth low-energy and WiFi capabilities. Sensor fusion and intelligent algorithms are employed to estimate the relevant gasses.\n\n![systems diagram 2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/109J142Mrh2rz4yOuqvStpCAyW9xFw7PG/view)\n\nPlease learn more about our stack in our DeRtB Github.\n\n# IV. Under Development (Stage 2)\n\nThe Decentralized Right to Breath started with a BreathTaking device to measure the attributes of people’s breaths. The second phase of the project offers a methodology to understand, measure, and protect the right to breathe, while empowering individuals and communities to take meaningful real-world action. \n\nThe functional objectives include:\n\n**Digital representation of the physical world of breath:**\n\n- A physical BreathTaking device, which captures the data of people’s breaths and combines it with 3rd party data like localized air quality\n- A chat interface and API allows different projects and people to send “evidence” of real-world action that “saves” breaths.\n- An AI entity embodies the concept of “breath”, passing judgment on the evidence to estimate the number of breaths saved.\n- Dynamic NFTs (dNFTs) are minted to represent these saved breaths, capturing quantitative and qualitative attributes of the real-world interaction, e.g. CO2 captured, biomass created, O2 generated, and breaths saved. The NFTs evolve as new relevant “evidence” enters the system.\n\n**Measurement of environmental impact**\n\n1.) Different types of action have different environmental impacts. The library of dynamic NFTs minted can be analyzed to represent environmental impact measured in e.g. CO2 captured, O2 generated, breaths saved, or even kg of resources up-cycled.\n\n2.) The AI entity that represents breath captures personal stories and nuances related to air quality and breathing rights, making our measurement of environmental impact more than 1s and 0s.\n\n**Community engagement and education**\n\n1.) Create a platform that celebrates, empowers, and incentivizes people who can provide evidence of real-world action to increase the availability of breath by gamifying and measuring environmental impact in the proxy metric of breath.\n\n2.)Every interaction with the system adds to the library of knowledge and methodologies, acting as educational resources and tools to help users understand the actions they can take to improve air quality, their health, and the state of the environment.\n\n3.) Breaths saved / dNFTs could be redeemed for real-world experiences / value, for example, half-price tram tickets.\n\n**Adaptability and governance**\n\nThe Breath AI Entity will be governed by a charter which defines the rules and methodologies to estimate breaths and validate evidence. The charter will be initiated by the project team and, over time, be governed and adapted by the community.\n\n**Technical Approach**\n\n1. Building the chatbot interface, LLM, and API\n\n- Configuring instructions, resources, and tools for the DeRtB LLM\n- Writing the initial charter and designing the governance of the charter\n- Integrating the interface(s) for the chatbot (GPT, Telegram, webapp, and/or app)\n- Developing the API for communication between modules and submission of “evidence”\n\n2. Developing the dynamic NFTs (dNFTs)\n\n- Select NFT parameters including dynamic attributes\n- Design artistic representation of dNFT data\n- Write smart contract for dynamic NFTs, extending the existing Right to Breathe NFT smart contracts\n\n3. System testing and deployment\n\n- Provide examples for estimated breaths in different scenarios of evidence\n- Create and execute unit tests on testnet for each module and the system as a whole\n- Deploy on mainnet\n\n ![solutions diagram 2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1006PTGz3zmQpuSCP67XhTUe0DL3fZALS/view)\n",

                "**TL;DR:**\n\nDeRtB (Decentralized Right to Breathe) by LoPh+ uses blockchain technology to create a bottom-up right to breathe, promoting environmental actions and community-driven governance, while seeking funding to advance its innovative breath measurement and incentivization platform.\n\n # I. deRtB, a New Era for Rights in the Blockchain Age\n\nWelcome to deRtB (Decentralized Right to Breathe), a groundbreaking initiative by LoPh+ poised to revolutionize how we understand and protect our fundamental rights. LoPh+ is a Vienna-based non-profit specializing in decentralized justice and community-based governance, and launched deRtB in the belief that breathing is a fundamental, universal experience involving not just humans, but plants, animals, and the entire atmosphere. Indeed, we all share an atmosphere, making the right to breathe a fundamental concern where everyone, including nature, is a stakeholder. \n\nOur aim is to create a decentralized framework that captures the shared stakes of breath, using innovative technologies for measuring, raising awareness, and incentivizing collective action. We believe our project embodies both the fundamental values of Ethereum, including openness, decentralization, censorship resistance, auditability, and cooperation, and the collaborative, interconnectedness, and grass-root spirit of the Zuzalu community.\n\nImagine a world where rights are not dictated by governments or powerful entities but are truly decentralized, community-driven, and adaptable to the needs of every individual as well as nature. That's the world DeRtB aims to create.\n\n**Core Principles & Why deRtB Matters**\n\nEmpowerment. DeRtB shifts protection of rights from the state to individuals, ensuring privacy, bodies, and the planet are safeguarded. \n\nInclusivity. It envisions an inclusive future free from constraints like race and gender, where everyone and nature thrive. \n\nAdaptability. Using a blockchain-based approach, DeRtB adapts rights to changing times and community needs. \n\nIncentivization. By promoting innovation through incentives and shared values, it moves away from traditional punishment and force. DeRtB is a grassroots experiment for a decentralized, democratized future for rights.\n\n\n# II. Our Goals\nOur vision is to build a breath ecology by incentivizing real-world activities that improve breathability, such as enhancing biodiversity, improving air quality, and reducing CO2 emissions. Currently, traditional markets and price mechanisms fail to value such crucial impact work. To change this, we need a new social and tech architecture that creates environmental and economic value for all stakeholders through collective care work.\n\nIn the first stage of our project, we used art to introduce blockchain-based tools and raise awareness about the precarious nature of our breaths and the individual agency each person holds in creating a healthier atmosphere. \n\nBuilding on this foundation, the second stage, for which we seek support and funding, aims to create the architecture to measure and protect a community-driven right to breathe, empowering individuals and communities to take meaningful real-world action.\n",

                  "Adding zupass gated access to our events is the main task we need to accomplish before Thailand, hopefully being tested in September in Singapore and deployed before ETH Global SF in October. \n\nA testimony of Shaka's previous contribution to Zuzalu inspired event- My first experience with Zuzalu culture was with ZuConnect in Istanbul. I received a scholarship for attendance and had the privilege of gifting ukulele workshops in the evenings. As a community we used chat gpt mixed with some original lyrics and simple music I composed to create the first Zuzalu song. We assembled the Open-Source Orchestra to lead the whole community in singing this song alongside Vitalik during the closing party at Suma Han. \nI assisted StreamETH in the audio for the main programming at ZuConnect. Before joining Ethereum, as an independent artist and previous road crew for a traveling band I have gathered the necessary skills to manage live production for events. My second Zuzalu inspired gathering was a two-month artist residency in Vitalia where I also stepped up to run the a/v production for their first four major summits. \nMy most recent experience with Zuzalu culture, which has occurred during quarter two, was with ZuBerlin and ZuKastle. I was invited to be a major contributor to building, running, and tearing down their main production hall alongside the legendary squirrel and founders of Ethereum. This was a great experience and I dearly cherish the friendships and the opportunity to contribute. The Open-Source Orchestra protocol had a strong presence in gathering musicians for multiple jams sessions, dance parties, a main stage jam, and a dinner performance in the courtyard alongside fire dancers. \nAfter two years in this community living the dream as a traveling musician, now nicknamed the Ethereum Bard, my presence at Zuberlin and ZuKastle is a sign of my maturing and being deeply inspired by not only Ethereum values, but those also of Zuzalu. I believe I am walking into the fullness of how I can continue to make a lasting impact on this community alongside those who also consider themselves apart of the Open-Source Orchestra. \nVolunteering with ETH Global hackathons as well as many other ETH events has been a staple part of my contributions in Ethereum. With that entry into events bringing all my instruments and providing a space for hackers to re energize and find inspirations in the middle of the night with music is not only a great service to the hackathon but also apart of how we have scaled the participants in the Open-Source Orchestra.",

                " Open-Source-Orchestra\n*ZUZALU Q2 Tech Round Application*\n\nIntroduction\nThe Open-Source Orchestra (OSO) is a unique initiative born from the tradition of musicians gathering at Ethereum events. Originating at ETH Prague 2022, this protocol of gathering musicians within the Ethereum community has been embraced by Zuzalu-inspired events. As a Zuzalu TECH PROJECT, OSO stands out for its multifaceted contributions, from providing technical support to fostering community spirit through music.\n\nTECH QUALIFICATIONS AND INTEGRATIONS\nAs we plan ahead for assisting in hosting a music space for Devcon SEA we will integrate a simple sign up database using Zupass for signers to book openings in the various slots hosted by the open-source orchestra, as well as providing a social wall for non-playing audiences to provide verses and clues for the open-source orchestra to play around. For example the chat gpt prompts provided to our ethereum Bard to tell the story of protocols and even tell the tail of Zuzalu. As we like to plan ahead for permissionless and open contributions this could help us encourage alignment with the simple onboard of signing into our sign up database with Zupass. \n\nCore Qualities and Contributions\nThe OSO brings several key benefits to events:\n1. Technical Support:\nWe provide audio and video technical assistance, including load-in/load-out services, stage construction, and decoration. Our appreciation and use of StreamETH allows us to serve as an in-real-life provider for their live streaming stack.\n2. Community Building:\nOur primary passion is social engineering through music, fostering connections and enhancing the atmosphere at events. We write and perform songs that inspire and motivate participants, embodying the role of Ethereum Bards.\n3. Event Enhancement:\n Our presence at events prioritizes the success of the event overall, often taking on roles such as stage coordinators and hosts to ensure open and permissionless participation, reflecting the ethos of the open-source internet that underpins the Ethereum network.\n\nFounding and Evolution\nThe OSO was founded by Jakub Vysoky of the Ethereum Foundation, Matteo Tambussi of SpaghettETH, and Shaka Lei Kaumaka, an Ethereum Bard and hard working event contributor. The initiative began at ETH Prague 2022 and quickly expanded, leading to the creation of a DevCon improvement proposal for a music space at Devcon LATAM in Bogota. This proposal was a resounding success and set the stage for further collaborations, including upcoming plans for DEVCON SEA.\n\n\nPersonal Journeys and Contributions\nShaka Lei Kaumaka: \nMy journey in Ethereum started at Devconnect in Amsterdam, where I volunteered for ETH Global and performed music, leading to a memorable introduction to the community. My experiences include organizing and performing at various events all around the world, contributing to the culture and community through music and production. I have been actively involved in Zuzalu culture, including ZuConnect in Istanbul, where we created the first Zuzalu song and led community performances. As a nomad based out of my instrument cases, I've made a home at Ethereum and Zuzalu inspired events doing my absolute best to make sure this Open-Source-Orchestra protocol can exist as a gift wherever I’m present.\n\nMatteo Tambussi: \nAs a publishing musician since 2001 and a project developer in the Ethereum ecosystem since 2018, I have been an integral part of OSO since its inception. I have seen the project grow and evolve, with developers showcasing their musical talents and forming unique collaborations. We have explored the integration of web3 technology in live music, building dapps to enhance audience engagement and creating new economic systems for music. During Devcon Bogota, we developed and tested a new dapp proof-of-concept to signal public appreciation on-chain. Read more about this initiative in our [article](https://matlemad.medium.com/how-the-fellowship-of-the-ethereum-musicians-was-born-at-devconvi-bogot%C3%A0-5cda0b0b0400).\n\nJakub Vysoky:\nI have been attending / co-organising / volunteering Eth and OSS events for a long time (first PyCon US in 2008, first EthBerlin in 2018). I was always traveling with my little companion: a ukulele. Small 4-string instrument that can bring joy and is super light to carry with you all the time. I was always having a lot of fun playing with different people at different events. But only a reunion with my fellow pythonista, musician and cryptographer Justin Holmes with instruments in our hands at Devconnect Amsterdam and shortly after meeting Shaka at EthPrague 2022 paved the path for the musical sub-community of Ethereum. From that time, we are meeting at different events and always have more instruments and more people involved. I am a Python software developer, devops engineer and community builder. I love all parts of the ecosystem. I want the musicians to feel welcome among engineers and the musicians inside of every engineer not to be afraid of popping up! I want to have a chance to make more jams happen and have a true decentralized band and solid stage experience.\n\nTECHNICAL NOTES -\nZupass- \nHaving used Zupass at Devconnect Istanbul for logging in to gated Telegram chat groups and voting on anonymous Polls, I think it is a perfect data wallet for our community. I can imagine zero-knowledge band. Just saying: I play mandolin, sing and I own a small amp. After joining an event, the audience don't have to know exactly who is coming, but you know there will be a mandolin, an amp and a singer. Of course, you could even reveal your full presence.\n\nGithub>\nWe need to create Github organisation, have a website and be able to create an event on a calendar for people to know, where Open Source Orchestra is going to appear!  Simple pull requests would work, but maybe generating it from some king of Zupass data would be pretty cool.\n\n\n\nAchievements and Financial Support\n\nOSO has been supported by various grants and stipends, enabling us to continue our work and expand our presence at events. Our greatest accomplishment has been our partnership with the Devcon team in hosting a music space open to the community. At both Devcon and Devconnect we hosted jams and Shaka was able to use his relationship with Kala Ukuleles to donate ukuleles to local youth foundations after the instruments were used during the conferences. He was awarded a Devcon Scholarship allowing for a strong focus to be placed on the Chiva Chillout Lounge OSO hosted in Bogota.\n\n Notable financial support for 2024 include:\n- $2,000 and free housing scholarship for artist residency in Vitalia\n- $5,000 stipend for production work in Vitalia\n- $1,010 volunteer stipend for ETH Global London\n- Free housing scholarship for ZuBerlin\n- $1,000 retroactive reward for contributions at ZuBerlin\n\nWe now have a multi-sig wallet to manage future support for OSO, ensuring transparency and integrity in the use of funds.\n\n\nEvent Participation and Future Roadmap\nPast Gigs:\n- 2022: Devconnect Amsterdam, ETH Global Amsterdam, ETH Prague, ETH Global NYC, ETH Barcelona, ETH CC, ETH Berlin, ETH Global Mexico, ETH Global Bogota, Devcon 6\n- 2023: ETH Denver, ETH Global Waterloo, ETH Global Paris, ETH Global NYC, ZuConnect, ETH Global Istanbul, Devconnect Istanbul, ETH India\n- 2024: Vitalia, ETH Denver, ETH Global London, ETH Berlin, ETH Prague, ZuBerlin - ETH CC week with lots of special gigs \n- ETH GLOBAL BRUSSELS\n- ZuCastle\n\nFuture and literal ‘’Road’’map for 2024:\n- ZuVillage Georgia \n- Burning Man\n- Ethereum Mexico\n- ETH Singapore \n- ETH Global Singapore\n- ETH GLOBAL SF\n- DEVCON SEA\n-ETH Global Bangkok \n- ZUTHAILAND \n- ZUINDIA\n- ETH INDIA \n- ETH HAWAII \n\nCall to Action\nCreating a strong mechanism for the OSO is important and a great focus for our efforts moving forward. We need a website, decentralized communication tools, and a Zupass gated sign up database to assist us in our strong presence in the Ethereum and Zuzalu community IRL. We aim to grow OSO into a foundational value for enabling artists on-chain. OSO is a gift to the Ethereum community, and with your support, we can continue to cultivate this unique and vibrant initiative.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe Open-Source Orchestra is more than just a musical group; it is a decentralized, community-driven initiative that enhances the Ethereum ecosystem through music, technical support, and community building. With continued support, we aim to grow OSO into a global collective that leverages web3 technology to create new opportunities for musicians and event participants alike. OSO is truly decentralized, a public good, and owned by no one. It’s a gift to the Ethereum Community we hope grows strongly in the garden of infinity.\n\n\n\n\n",

                  "At ZuConnect, there were a lot of discussions around the future of Zuzalu and how to scale Zuzalu to the size of Burning Man without diluting the core value and ethos of the community - in other words, how to balance inclusivity and exclusivity. \n\nCommunity Graphs is our best response to that question. By mapping group memberships, and the extent of members’ involvement, we can improve community stewardship and governance, facilitate better interactions, and unlock more robust and scalable reputation systems.\n\nWe’re currently working with the Zuzalu software development team and will be supporting a bunch of upcoming ZuVillages like Georgia, Crecimiento, Edge Lanna and the FTC Residency in Chiang Mai, as well as hackathons like EthSafari, etc. \n\nAt these events, organizers can use Community Graphs to moderate access, and attendees can self-organize and create their own groups around common interests. Builders can also leverage Community Graphs to better serve communities by retrieving group memberships and levels into their applications and reputation systems.\n\nThese reputation systems can improve Zuzalu grant rounds, and other public goods projects like Gitcoin, Optimism, FTC, and Octant (all in our partner pipeline) by providing social sybil and collusion resistance. Additionally, Optimism has expressed interest in leveraging Community Graphs to improve Governance.\n\nMembership levels and reputation systems can also help improve the way groups add new members. For example, those with higher membership levels might be able to invite more new members than those on a periphery. And over time, those who do a better job curating new members might gain a higher reputation in that regard, granting them additional invites. These are some ways in which Zuzalu’s growth can be stewarded. \n\nIronically, in attempting to answer the question of how Zuzalu can grow to the size of Burning Man, we’ve also been approached by the Burning Man Org about using Community Graphs, as they are facing a lot of the same issues, just at a bigger scale.",

Identity and reputation systems can even be stacked for a stronger signal (for example, a community might require that you have at least a Gitcoin Passport score of 20 plus a Proof of Humanity). In addition, an algorithm for a reputation system might take another reputation system as an input, or membership levels of a certain community as an input. Our goal is to create the maximum surface area for people to build, combine, and experiment with different social coordination tools.\n\nPrivacy: all aspects of a community can be made private, from the existence of the community itself to the list of members and membership levels. In addition, all attestations are fully private.\n\nDecentralization & Censorship Resistance: all data and computation will be fully decentralized while remaining private, and additionally, each community member will own their own data and will have the option to export their data, providing additional censorship resistance.\n",

(2) Voting applications such as ZuPoll and Carbonvote can incorporate membership levels to give more weight to the votes of members who are more central to a community.  (3) Projects such as zuzalu.city can retrieve lists of communities and community members to populate their Community Spaces.   In addition, anyone working on identity and reputation systems can make those tools available to communities in Community Graphs. And anyone looking to benefit from a reputation system can retrieve that information from Community Graphs in order to improve their community’s sybil resistance, collusion resistance, governance, etc. For example, a DAO might want to leverage a reputation system for how it rates its delegates, or for how it funds open-source contributors.

                "Community Graphs significantly improves social coordination by more accurately representing group membership, and the extent of each member’s involvement. This enhances social dynamics, improves community governance, and unlocks the development of more robust, scalable reputation systems.\n\nMembers in groups privately attest to one another’s’ level of involvement in a group, and concepts behind Web of Trust and Quadratic Voting are applied to produce membership levels which exist on a continuum. \n\nThese levels can be incorporated in group voting to give more weight to those who are more deeply involved, or to allow them to invite more new members into that group than someone on the periphery.\n\nOverlapping memberships between groups can be used to improve reputation systems, as trust and credibility is established in one community and then extended to other communities based on members they have in common and their respective membership levels. Communities themselves can also have reputations, which they can stake to give their members’ reputations a much farther reach than can be achieved with social graphs alone.\n\nThese types of scalable reputation systems unlock many new social coordination tools, including social-based sybil and collusion resistance, battling misinformation and deep fakes, and uncollateralized lending. \n\nCommunity Graphs is modular and composable, allowing anyone to integrate or build their own attestation mechanisms, voting algorithms, and reputation systems. \n",

It aims to connect a remote audience to the latest Ethereum knowledge, addressing existing barriers like high travel costs, visa restrictions and health reasons.\n\nCryptocurrency's illegality in many parts of the world makes it simple for institutions to censor content distribution on traditional media platforms. By leveraging Web3 protocols, such as Livepeer, Swarm, Dm3 protocol, and IPFS, StreamETH ensures distributed and censorship-resistant video delivery, storage and audience interaction.\n\nThrough the same protocols, StreamETH created a distributed and immutable archive for Ethereum’s knowledge (and history) to forever live on-chain.\n\nOver the year, we amplified and brought on-chain over 20 events such as Devcon Bogotá, Devconnect Ams, Zuzalu, and more, connecting global audiences to the forefront of Ethereum, covering topics like Public Goods, L2s, Rollups, Technical Decentralisation, EVMs, DAOs and Governance, and addressing barriers for attendees like high travel costs, visa restrictions and health reasons.\n\nWe distributed on-chain over 1.5k workshops, talks and panels and archived over 500 of them. From keynotes to workshops we archived the best minds in the space discussing topics that range from entry-level difficulty to blockchain specialist, making sure they will always be available for anyone to watch and learn from, regardless of politics-related restrictions, bans or censorship.\n\nOur livestreams and archives have been watched over 25k times and will forever be available to the Ethereum community, permissionless.",

                '# The problem\n$700M was wasted in 2023 on Kickstarter alone when fully funded projects never deliver what was promised. This is because traditional crowdfunding platforms fail to provide guarantees. \n\n### The solution\n![howitworks](https://i.imgur.com/N74nlT5.png)\nviaPrize solves this by taking the funds for a project and then welcoming anyone to complete the project. If no one completes the project, then everyone is refunded. \n\nPrizes include three types of contributors:\n![benefitsforusers](https://i.imgur.com/9xmyEhR.png)\nPrize proposers come up with the project idea\nPrize funders elevate the best ideas by showing demand\nPrize contestants win rewards building the project\n\nWith viaPrize, ideas are crowdsourced, rewards are crowdfunded, and project execution is an open invitation.\n\n### The Middle Road for Public Goods Funding\nPrizes open up a complementary alternative in the public goods funding ecosystem that balances funder confidence and builder security. \n\nGitcoin optimizes for builder security because it gives upfront funds, but lacks funder confidence because there is no guarantee of success. \n\nOptimism Retro PGF optimizes for funder confidence because funders review the impact of existing projects and add rewards, but lacks builder security because there is no guarantee of any particular amount of funding.\n\nWith prizes, funders know the project will be built or they are refunded, so they have some confidence. Builders know there is a certain amount of funding waiting for them if they successfully create a project, so they have some security. \n\n![Balancing](https://i.imgur.com/iLPihrt.png)\nWe look forward to a full public goods funding user journey where you receive:\nQF Grant - Before building (and ongoing)\nCrowdfunded Prize - When you finish building (prizes for a whole product and prizes for particular features)\nRetro PGF - When you see the impact of what was built\n\n### Our origins\nThe concept of crowdfunded prizes sounded revolutionary as Noah discussed it with residents of the entrepreneurs\' pop-up city Zuzalu, so we tested it. As residents discussed the idea of making an AI voice for a river, Noah launched a prize and residents tossed in $20. After an impromptu five day hackathon attracting twelve builders, we presented the first AI voice for a nature entity in history to the Prime Minister of Montenegro. If we had used Kickstarter, then only the team who posted an idea would receive funds. By using prizes, any builder was welcome.\n![RiverAITeam](https://imgur.com/tdrnul7.png)\n\nHowever, Noah wanted to be certain this can make a real impact. Thus, he found himself watching anti-missile defense shoot down a kamikaze drone as it dove towards him while on the way to deliver medical supplies in Ukraine, funded by a prize from viaPrize.org\nThe medics ended up using the supplies treating 45 injured and saving multiple lives, and Noah decided to pursue this initiative full time.\n![myfavoriteprize](https://i.imgur.com/TxlQzz1.png)\n\n### Traction\n\nAs of July, 2024 we have distributed over $50,000 and have successful prizes for building projects ranging from free productivity apps to writing competitions.\nWe take a 5% platform fee. \n\n### Thank You Gitcoin!\n\nThis has all been accomplished since June 2023 with our only funding coming from over 1000 donors on Gitcoin plus matching. Thank you for making this possible!\n\nMore about that here:\nhttps://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-appreciations-thread/18332\n\n### Traditional Fundraisers\n\nIn Jan 2024, we added crowdfunding "fundraisers" with two types:\n"Pass-through" where funds are immediately directed to the recipient\n"All-or-nothing" where you refund everyone if the funding goal is not met by the deadline\n\n### Next steps\n\nMVP - Tested during Zuzalu\nV1 - Current version. Usable for crypto natives\nV2 - By the end of Jul 2024. Easier onboarding for web2 users.\nV3 - By the end of Sep 2024. Accessibility for people in developing countries by having a mobile app and cash off-ramps around the world for those who do not have bank accounts.\n\nWe are incubating the project by living with users and iterating on their feedback during Zuzalu inspired pop up villages around the world. \n\n### Connect!\nSee opportunities to win prizes: https://x.com/viaprize\n\n### Try it out!\nVisit viaprize.org and post a prize or portal today! \nThe proposers of a prize idea also receive 5% of the award. \nLet\'s build public goods!',

Advance innovations in blockchain. \n\nEligibility Requirements – Xenofon Kontouris’ Response:\n1. I have attended ZuConnect for two weeks. I am a substantial decision-maker for the tech project itself. I will be responsible for being the point of contact for the Q2 round including ensuring transparency in how the funds are used. By January 1st, 2025, I, the responsible person, shall declare how the funds were used via Zuzagora or its successor. I am the only point of contact responsible for applying in the Q2 Tech Round.\n2. I am and shall be transparent about other sources of funding, which at present there is none.\n3. I participated in a previous Zuzalu Gitcoin round, and I have declared exactly how those funds were used here. Some of the funds were used differently than the application initially stated because of growing pains and limitations on teambuilding and fundraising. The justification is simple; most project do not grow according to their initial plan. \n4. The projects does create value for the Zuzalu ecosystem through, A. Assisting in the experience/organization of Zuzalu gatherings, and B. Furthering experiments or applications in blockchain, biotech/longevity, AI x web3, and/or ZK\n5. Blockchain-facing tech is maximally compatible with Ethereum and common Ethereum ecosystem and standards.\n6. Projects is open source, and there is no code that is closed source, as of yet. If closed source code is included, it shall be justified in the January 1st, 2025 report. Below we include the verified GitHub of one of the community’s technical leads, Axel Geshlin. \n7. A. If you have an idea - share your roadmap B. If in development - share Github and state which open-source license it has C. If a working product, share Github, license, and demo video\n\nLastly, you can find our initial proposed roadmap and update on Zuzagora, linked here:  https://www.agora.city/t/introducing-zuforever-events-and-tools-grant-participant-for-q1-2024/433\n\nYou can find more about the author of the proposal here: https://www.linkedin.com/in/xenofon/",

                  "A collective consists of individuals.\n\nCollective decision-making is built on individual sense-making.\n\nProblem: Without the individual ability to question one’s own sense and thought, ambitions towards collective sense-making become dysfunctional.\n\nSolution: Socratic.Bot provides a tool to build awareness of one's own beliefs, to update them towards a truth-seeking direction and to communicate them in a clear structure.\n\nMain functions:\n\nProactively aiding individual Zuzaluan minds:\n -to untangle their thoughts and emotions by reflection\n -to identify their beliefs and biases by socratic questioning\n -to update, balance and integrate their mental models\n -to build their arguments based on relevance and consistency\n -to refine their articulation towards precision and nuance\n -to overall increase their quality of reasoning and judgement\n\nBy that, over time sustainably improve:\n -their ability to think clearly and recognize patterns\n -their potential for intellectual cross-pollination\n -their defense against groupthink and propaganda\n -their understanding of the bigger picture of a discussion\n -their ability to understand each other’s framings and intentions\n -their ability to identify shared intentions towards collective action\n -their overall ability to identify their own agency, curiosity and doubt\n\n\nResulting in value for the Zuzalu Ecosystem by: \n-aiding to the overall quality of the discourse\n -building a collective intelligence on individual cognitive qualities\n -increasing the depth and nuance of collective sense-making processes\n -decreasing the dependency on voting for collective decision-making processes\n -protecting our culture against anti-intellectual tendencies like populism or collectivism\n -increasing the accessibility of our communication culture to new talent\n -expanding the interoperability of our communities onto the cultural dimension\n -increasing the individual’s ability to self-select by informed consent\n -overall, aid to Zuzalu’s potential by raising quality along growth in numbers\n\nZuzalu is an ambitious project in human coordination for technological and societal development. Individual cognitive sovereignty is a prerequisite for functional collective sense-making and decision-making; individuals have to be able to think for themselves before coordinating on a group-level, otherwise people are led into groupthink. Socratic.Bot is not just a passive AI assistant, but rather a proactive, socratic interviewer that prompts humans to think critically, question their assumptions, and refine their arguments for functional human to human discussion and coordination.\n\nDuring ZuConnect, we tested utilizing Socratic.Bot during a Zuzalu governance discussion, where individuals could first examine and reine their arguments individually before discussing as a group. Our first Zuzalu-native integration is with Zuzagora, as a tool for users to prepare their arguments while creating a discussion post for the long-form Zuzalu discussion forum. This improves the individual argumentative experience while participating in Zuzalu discussions and helps raise the quality of the overall discussion.\n\nOur future modules, integrated directly into Zuzalu.city Community Spaces, will further help individuals in the Zuzalu ecosystem engage in discussions effectively and improve their critical thinking capabilities as our movement grows.",

                "# Introduction\n\nZupass is powering a new generation of digital communities, network states, pop-up villages, decentralized organizations, and more with zero-knowledge technology. Since its inception and incubation at Zuzalu in 2023, more than 20,000 people have created a Zupass, collectively generating hundreds of thousands of ZKPs for identity management, community management, governance, and more.\n\nZupass takes the form of a simple wallet-like webapp that can be accessed on a mobile phone or desktop browser. It can store various kinds of cryptographic data—tickets, passports, badges, or receipts of participation. But it does more than store data—it also lets users make ZK proofs about that data, and share those proofs with a permissionless ecosystem of third-party developers.\n\nZupass and the PCD (proof-carrying data) framework act as a data layer for digital communities, on top of which tools for managing identity, membership, governance, and more can be built. Last year, third-party developers built tools for [online and offline access control](https://zukit-example.vercel.app/), [polling](https://zupoll.org/), [community forums](https://zuca.st/), [faucets](https://twitter.com/_pk910_/status/1721472568765345955), [games](https://twitter.com/sunbh_eth/status/1725571587057795079), and more on top of the open Zupass protocols and data formats.\n\nZupass and the PCD framework are fully open-source and community-oriented, with particular attention towards empowering developers with [workshops](https://www.notion.so/Zupass-at-Istanbul-43f678e8344543118cffc6e4deb67f32?pvs=21), [educational resources](https://twitter.com/austingriffith/status/1724131612856627396), tutorials, and more. We envision a world where the world’s data ecosystems are maximally open and interoperable, where privacy is a default, and where users can own and control their own data thanks to the power of ZK cryptography. Ground zero for this vision is the Zuzalu community.\n\n### Zupass and Zu-Communities\n\nZupass was first used at Zuzalu, as a backbone for interoperability between community tools. It allowed residents and visitors to access venues, vote in polls, and to authenticate to websites including Zuzalu.City and Zucast. Since Zuzalu, community platforms including [Zuzagora](https://www.zuzagora.com/), [Fora](https://fora.co/) and [Lemonade](https://lemonade.social/) have built integrations to issue and/or verify tickets through Zupass.\n\nAt ZuConnect, Zupass was used to provide tickets, polls, and new features including gated Telegram chat and an [anonymous chat bot](https://t.me/zurat_bot). Hackathon projects were able to leverage Zupass for use-cases including [zero-knowledge clinical trial](https://github.com/seeincodes/zuhack-istanbul) participation, [issuance of tickets](https://github.com/lemonadesocial/lemonade-zupass/) for additional events, and even [sharing of horoscopes](https://github.com/raigal-r/zuAstro).\n\nAt Devconnect Istanbul, we launched FrogCrypto - a game based around collecting cryptographically-signed frogs. Hundreds of thousands of frogs were collected, and over 400 people received a Frog Hat for collecting more than 50 frogs. More importantly, the aim of showing--not just explaining--the potential of proof-carrying data was achieved. For many people, these were their first tangible experiences of zero-knowledge cryptography, showing how real-world use-cases can be addressed by ZK.\n\nIn 2024, Zupass and the ZK data ecosystem have been involved in various Zuzalu ecosystem events — Vitalia, Edge City Denver, Edge Esmeralda, and ZuVillage Georgia — among other community-organized events. We’re also excited to see Zupass and Zuzalu-native tech increasingly being used at Ethereum events, such as ETH LATAM, ETHBerlin, and ETHPrague. Several community-developed projects that build on the ZK data ecosystem like Zuzagora have become central parts of the Zuzalu commuity, and projects like Zupoll and SocialLayer have been deployed across a variety of in-person and virtual engagements.\n\n![Frogcrypto](https://i.ibb.co/MBh1pdk/fc-devconnect.png)\n\n*FrogCrypto at ZuConnect & Devconnect*\n\n![Badges](https://i.ibb.co/q9RG3Gj/badges.png)\n\n*Various Zu-event passes in Zupass so far*\n\n![ETHBerlin winners](https://i.ibb.co/7WM3B0g/ethberlin-pics.png)\n\n*Zuzalu-native tooling being used at ETHBerlin*\n\n![Esmeralda](https://i.ibb.co/1ngnwBj/Screenshot-2024-07-17-at-11-55-00-AM.png)\n\n*Several projects presenting at Edge Esmeralda’s [Pop-Up City Infrastructure](https://edgeesmeralda.sola.day/event/detail/7299) event*\n\n### Zupass roadmap and impact\n\nIn 2023 and the first half of 2024, we gave over 20,000 people an experience of ZK cryptography in real life, and issued over 1,000,000 PCDs. In the second half of 2024, we aim to take Zupass and PCDs to the next level, building the foundation for the next billion PCDs.\n\nTo do this, we will:\n\n- Empower communities to issue their own data as Proof-Carrying Data (PCD), whether it’s tickets, badges, virtual world items, web of trust endorsements, or voting receipts. Issuance of PCDs will be point-and-click and self-service, and is already available on [podbox.dev](http://podbox.dev).\n- Empower developers to create new social tools for communities by substantially expanding the suite of open source libraries, zero-knowledge circuits, API integrations, and developer tools available on top of or alongside ZK-compatible cryptographic data.\n\nWe want to grow the number of Zupass users, but also the number of PCD issuers, and massively diversify the kinds of PCDs that can be issued. The second half of 2024 will be all about helping communities to create PCDs as well as use them.\n\n### About the Team\n\nZupass is built and maintained by a very small team (three full-time developers, plus various part-time contributors and community members) who are funded by 0xPARC Foundation to work on Zupass/PCD as a fully open-source and community-oriented project. With support from this QF round, the team will be able to continue operating and delivering high-quality software for communities in a way that is aligned with the vision and values of Zuzalu, Ethereum, and other similar movements.\n\n## Links and Further Reading\n\n- [Zupass](https://app.streameth.org/watch?session=zupass&event=progcrypto) (ProgCrypto 2023)\n- [Devconnect Zupass Starter Kit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SGaMHOYc04) with Austin Griffith\n- [Zupass Internals and the PCD SDK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pq0hKc1tEkM) (EthGlobal Istanbul 2023)\n- [Zupass Builders Hub](https://t.me/+4y2UPVbfi24xNWEx) Telegram group",

                "A proof of concept for a decentralised pandemic defence network, focusing specifically on the early detection phase.\n\nPandemic preparedness is a critical topic and it's fairly clear that a lot of countries were underprepared for COVID. There are reasonable mechanisms to suggest that pandemics may increase in frequency (especially given the increasing availability of bioengineering combined with AI lowering the threshold for someone inexperienced to be able to do this).\n\nWe believe that every stage of pandemic defence should be decentralised and open source. \n\nLoosely speaking, combatting a pandemic involves both defensive measures (early detection, isolation, PPE, far-UVC, etc.) and offensive measures (eg vaccines and treatment). \n\nThere is already some innovation in this space supported by Vitalik and Balvi (moonshot anti-covid effort funded by @ShibainuCoin @CryptoRelief_) This includes vaccine development (RADVAC/PopVax), air monitoring systems/air cleaning, patient-led research into Long COVID, Epiwatch, real-time analysis of open-source data to provide better early warnings of outbreaks and more.\n\n**Vision**\nWe will focus on hardware-based early detection systems. This project will be formally initiated and worked on during ZuGeorgia (brainstorming, road-mapping and early prototyping phase).\n\nIn an ideal situation, a decentralised early warning system would consist of globally distributed real-time PCR/sequencing machines that can sequence novel pathogens (via air, water or surfaces)*. Though current costs and reagent requirements make this impractical for now, this project will lay the groundwork for future implementations.\n\n*Sequencing novel pathogens, especially via a portable machine is extremely difficult but may not be necessary. There is evidence showing pandemics can be predicted by detecting genotypic changes accumulating in the global viral population which precede pandemic emergence (ie this could warn you BEFORE a pandemic has emerged)\n\n**Proof of concept**\nThe proof-of-concept will be scoped out and road mapped during ZuGeorgia but as a reasonable starting point, using biosensors makes a pragmatic and achievable target to begin with.\n\nWe will build a system that is robust, tamper-proof and has mechanisms of verifying data.\n\nWe will brainstorm the ideal starting point but the working thesis is building a proof of concept using temperature sensors (eg laser temperature gun), with a mechanism that data is signed with private/public key pairing before data has left the device (ie so data is verified at source) along with zK for privacy. \n\nThis is a pragmatic starting point as the hardware is cheap and technologically not complicated whilst paving the way for other hardware devices to be added (eg a PCR machine but more likely connections with air-quality monitoring such as Open CPC)\n\nA temperature detection system, especially placed at locations with high footfall eg airport/train stations would be useful but likely not an optimal way of detecting pandemics (mainly because at this point, the pandemic has already started to spread, an ideal detection system would warn you before it has even emerged)\n\nThe point of this project is to have a proof of concept, where hardware that users can buy can be connected to a global system that generates verified open-source data contributing to pandemic surveillance. This will provide work others can build on, and encourage other devices (eg Open CPC) to connect to the same network.\n\n**Scoping work (to be done in ZuGeorgia)**\n\nScoping work will include (but not limited to)\n- Is a temperature sensor the best (ie low cost, easy enough to do) proof of concept or should we explore other options (water-based sensors, agriculture sensors or other)\n- How many real-time PCR devices placed around the world would provide sufficient cover?\n- Detailed cost analysis of different sensor types and deployment strategies.\n- Developing robust, tamper-proof enclosures and data verification systems.\n",

                  "## Why Agora City (Zuzagora)?\nZuzagora started as a ZuPass-gated discussion platform and cognitive safe-space for the Zuzalu community, developed into a ZuPass-gated shared space for multiple villages that also have their own sub-platform, and is about to upgrade into a more accessible platform for whole Zuzalu Ecosystem that connects many existing and future ZuVillages and many existing and future Zuzalu tech projects.\n\nBefore Zuzagora, the main exchange platforms were Telegram channels – which had proven themselves dysfunctional, due to the level of distraction and entanglement of serious discussion attempts with emotion-driven reasoning and sentimental material. This lead to a race to the bottom in the overall quality of the open discourse, questionable dynamics for collective decision-making processes and a cultural shift towards trivial aspects. \n\nIn order to provide a fitting platform for meaningful discussions, we focused on providing a healthy information ecology, with a high signal-to-noise ratio and a clear communication culture, that is insight-based – in parallel co-existence with an increasing number of telegram channels for the easy-going exchange of a single community, that is rather vibe-based.\n\nUpfollowing, we created a Shared Town Square to provide interoperability between ZuVillages in terms of exchange – allowing the individuals of diverse communities to exchange and identify their shared interests towards collective action. On Zuzagora, Villagers of\n\n## Current functions\nMain functions that create value for the Zuzalu Ecosystem:\n- An open and clear discussion culture both between Zuzaleans and between ZuVillages.\n- Decrease our dependence on voting for collective decision-making processes, by providing a quality-based foundation that allows for productive discourse.\n- Providing a platform for asynchronous intellectual cross-pollination both aside and during events.\n- Providing a platform for democratic processes to be auditable and transparent, building on discussion and in-depth understanding.\n- Providing the individuals from diverse ZuVillages with a shared space to exchange about their experiences and knowledge, which can fulfill a decentralized info-defense function.\n\n## Next Steps\nZuzagora started as a forum for thoughtful discussion, and as a way for Zuzaleans to keep exchanging points of view regardless of being on an event IRL. After Zuzalu got decentralized, it took a more prominent place, as there was no single Zuzalu town square besides the forum and Town Halls. \n\n### Supporting Zuzalu’s decentralization\nWe are working to help include all ZuVillages that pop up and are aligned with the initial Zuzalu. \n\n### Decentralizing invitaitions\nLastly, we are working on a technical solution to grow the ecosystem more organic through a decentralized invitation system, leveraging the concept of vouching and Web of Trust. \nFor this we are creating a client that relies on: \n- OpenRank for the rank calculation (EigenTrust, same as Farcaster)\n- Privy: Seamless login for non crypto-native users\n- EAS: Ethereum Attestation Service, to create onchain attestations\n- ZuPass: To create new credentials for users\n\n### Crecimiento\nWe created a standalone forum for the Crecimiento movement. Since it doesn’t need Zupass gating (for now at least) and the main language is in Spanish (it is targeting Argentinean population), we decided to support by creating a custom solution that fits their needs.",

For instance, during a popup village's SQF (Streaming Quadratic Funding) round, which could last the entire duration of the village (e.g., one month), participants of the popup village can act as direct funders (and implicitly, voters that help direct matching funds). They can direct and redirect their funding as the contributions of different individuals evolve over the popup village’s duration.  Contributors to the popup village could take on various roles, such as managing fitness activities, leading mindfulness circles, organizing educational sessions related to biotech, etc. Each village will have different contributor roles, often starting as volunteer positions. By listing these roles as grantees on an SQF round and allowing fellow popup villagers to vote, these otherwise volunteer roles can become paid positions, with compensation dynamically reflecting the value perceived by the community.  Additionally, this model could extend beyond the bounds of a popup village. A Zuzalu ecosystem group could run an ongoing round throughout the year to compensate contributors for continuous efforts, such as writing recurring newsletters or handling social media marketing. This approach ensures continuous support and fair compensation for those contributing to said group.",

                "# ZuLand - Private Space for Zuzalu Citizens\n\n## Problem\nZuzalu citizens and villages currently don’t have any private and decentralized social space where they can communicate and organize autonomously while preserving their privacy. \n\n## Solution\nWe want to develop a private, decentralized solution where only Zu<City> attendees can read and write content.\n\nWe identified three components to make it happen:\n- **ZuPass**: Software for storing and managing Proof-Carrying Data (like signatures, Merkle proofs, zk proofs, hash commitments, and keypairs). It allows users to store and organize this data and respond to queries from third-party applications about them.\n- **Akasha Core**: Decentralized social network toolkit integrated with Ceramic ComposeDB.\n- **Lit Protocol**: Decentralized key management system (KMS) so users can encrypt data and control who can access and use their data.\n\nOur idea is to extend Akasha Core with Lit Protocol, allowing developers to use ready-made token-gated components for their social networks with customizable requirements and use ZuPass or ZuCitizenship to authenticate users in the social network and encrypt/decrypt content shared within the network.\n\nZuLand will be configured as a social extension of the Zuzalu.City platform, becoming part of a set of plug-in features from which each community can benefit.\n\n## Team Members\n- **drivenfast** - Core Zuzalu.City\n- **limone.eth** - PM & Fullstack Dev at builders.garden\n  - [warpcast.com/limone.eth](https://warpcast.com/limone.eth)\n  - [github.com/limone-eth](https://github.com/limone-eth)\n- **Fraye** - Backend Dev at builders.garden\n  - [warpcast.com/itsmide.eth](https://warpcast.com/itsmide.eth)\n  - [github.com/mmatteo23](https://github.com/mmatteo23)\n- **Bianc8** - Frontend Dev at builders.garden\n  - [warpcast.com/bianc8.eth](https://warpcast.com/bianc8.eth)\n  - [github.com/bianc8](https://github.com/bianc8)\n- **Darph** - Designer at builders.garden\n  - [warpcast.com/darph](https://warpcast.com/darph)\n- **Martin Ezrodt** - Akasha\n  - [github.com/etzm](https://github.com/etzm)\n- **Sever Abibula** - Akasha\n  - [x.com/Sever__S](https://x.com/Sever__S)\n  - [github.com/SeverS](https://github.com/SeverS)\n- **Marius Darila** - Akasha\n  - [x.com/MariusDarila](https://x.com/MariusDarila)\n  - [github.com/kenshyx](https://github.com/kenshyx)\n\n## Roadmap (August - September)\nThe work will be organized into 2 sprints of 1 month each.

Polling tools like Consider.it allow us to build a robust discussion layer on top of these basic voting functionalities, and allow discussion to occur without devolving into a shouting match of the loudest opinions.\n\nFinally, liquid democracy and proxying functionality will allow higher participation rates from the community, even in cases where a member may not have full knowledge or feel qualified to vote on any given issue. It does this by allowing you to, at any time, proxy your vote to someone else in the community, who can then vote on your behalf. This simple proxying mechanism, while simple in smaller communities, can become increasingly helpful to self-organize complexity of democratic structures at scale.",

Global Citizen’s 5M email list will be made available to us (for a fee) to broadcast our message of global democracy on-chain to millions of people at a moment of high political awareness in the United States -- the 2024 U.S. election.\n\nAfter building a working version of the software for the Zuzalu community, our plan is to bring in tens or hundreds of thousands of interested new users from the Global Citizen partnership, scaling donations and interested participants. \n\nOur goal is to rapidly kickstart the world’s first global democratic governance experiment at scale, and collectively learn-by-doing through proposing and then voting on global projects with collective funds to make true impact.",

                "We propose building a software stack that any Zuzalu community can use to democratically vote on how to spend collective funds. \n\nWe will start with governing the Vitalia Community funds from the Zuzalu Q1 round.\n\nWe plan to take inspiration from our friends and collaborators at Consider.it (https://consider.it), a visual voting UX that has been used in local governments like Seattle, as well as Liquid US (https://liquid.us), a liquid democracy voting software used by state governments in the U.S.\n\nThis will entail a UX that is easily accessible on mobile and desktop platforms, and a way to easily see things like: total community funds available, project proposals, and spent funds. Polling tools like Consider.it allow us to build a robust discussion layer on top of basic voting functionalities, and allow debate to occur without devolving into a shouting match of the loudest opinions.\n\nFinally, liquid democracy and proxying functionality will allow higher participation rates from the community, even in cases where a member may not have full knowledge or feel qualified to vote on any given issue. It does this by allowing you to proxy your vote to someone else in the community, who can then vote on your behalf. This simple proxying mechanism, while straightforward in smaller communities, can become increasingly helpful to self-organize complexity of democratic structures at scale.\n\nWe have a vision of using this technology to eventually facilitate meaningful global democratic governance beyond our Zuzalu communities.\n\nWe are able to reach 5 million people through the partnerships described in our Roadmap, as the next phase of this project. \n\nOur goal is to create something useful for Zuzalu that has a chance of providing accessible, democratic voting on shared resources for the world’s global citizens.",

                "Proof of passport is developing tools allowing users to generate proofs of humanity, nationality and age using their government-issued passport. We want to make it easy to extract the signed data from passport chips and verify it. It unlocks uses cases in proof of unique identity, sybil resistance and selective disclosure of private data.\n\nOur main work is the [proof of passport app and circuits](https://github.com/zk-passport/proof-of-passport) that currently supports the most common signature algorithms used by country authorities.\n\nThere is no additional trust assumption other than the issuing country. All proofs are generated on the user's device and the personal data stays there.\n\nOur work is fully open source. We believe in using and aggregating already existing attestations to let users build strong and reliable digital identities while only disclosing the information their want public.\n\nWe are actively looking for contributors to collect samples of passport data and help implementing verification circuits of lesser-used passport signing algorithms using available primitives (rsa/ecdsa/sha). Donations and matching will go towards funding new contributors.",

                "## About   \nAt Zuzalu, we believe in the power of open frontiers and decentralization to shape a future where every voice is heard, and every community thrives. Our journey continues with Zuzalu.city, providing an online space to build tools for Zuzalu software and empower communities.   \nAs we embark on this new journey, our primary goal is to cultivate a thriving community space that fosters collective collaboration. Zuzalu.city is more than a solution; it’s a catalyst for diverse initiatives and spin-off communities within and around Zuzalu.   \nTo achieve this, we are building open-source tools that empower everyone in our community. Coordinate builders in the community to build towards application experiences and tools both for/and independent of Zuzalu.city.   \n##    \n## Vision & Principles:   \nOur vision for Zuzalu software development is guided by five fundamental principles: Privacy, Ease-of-Use, Modularity, Composability, and Interoperability. These principles form the bedrock of our commitment to creating an online environment that is secure, user-friendly, flexible, customizable, and seamlessly interconnected.   \n### Definitions of principles:   \n- Privacy - Ensuring user data is private and in the control of users. Using privacy tech like ZKPs.   \n- Ease-of-Use - Focusing on spin-offs among other communities to be able to run their own sets of tools without deep technical knowledge.   \n- Modularity - Broken down independent modules and components each with their own attributes and functionality. This is to create more flexibility and be adapted to the needs of any given community.   \n- Composability - to be able to integrate a combination of various modules/primitives to create a customized, larger system.   \n- Interoperability - allows different systems or apps to interact and exchange data between them seamlessly.   \n   \n##    \n## Objective & Progress Update:   \n### Building Together:   \nZuzalu.city stands as a vibrant hub where collaboration thrives. Over 100 builders from various projects have joined forces, bringing their unique perspectives and skills to contribute to the Zuzalu ecosystem.   \nThe primary focus is to underscore interoperability between Zuzalu.city and various tools, ensuring seamless integration. A robust coordination process will be established, empowering community members to actively contribute and develop missing modules and components. This diverse group of contributors embodies the collaborative spirit that fuels our mission.   \n   \n*Invitations will be extended to [Element](https://explorer.gitcoin.co/[https://www.guilded.gg/r/zzME2L6mXR?i=d8D1Y90d](https://www.guilded.gg/r/zzME2L6mXR?i=d8D1Y90d)), enhancing community engagement with a focus on fostering meaningful and high-quality interactions.*   \n### Current List of Contributors   \n[Zuzalu Software Contributors](https://zu-builders.framer.website/),   \n###    \n### Progress Update:   \n- Zuzalu City is nearing its Alpha release, beginning with ZuVillage as the first community space and event in the app.    \n- Working with both Ceramic and OrbisDB teams, we've built much of the structure of the app on Ceramic. We are also making a shift to move from ComposeDB to OrbisDB for built-in functionality such as Gating and encryption via Lit Protocol.    \n- We have also built a full ticketing system working with Scroll team by designing and implement the smart contracts of scrollpass into the flow in addition to minting tickets for attendees. This will be launched soon after alpha is deployed.    \n- We are also working with other projects like LottoPGF, Blockful, streameth among a few others on testing their app directly on ZuCity and working towards integrating as an app within the structure of events and for community spaces. In addition to projects like Akasha + urbe.eth on decentralised social. View our list of integrations here: [https://zuzalu.craft.me/ZIzStdH9gNWmWI](https://zuzalu.craft.me/ZIzStdH9gNWmWI)   \n   \nLive DApp: [https://www.zuzalu.city/](https://www.zuzalu.city/)   \nTake a peek at the prototype (alpha): [https://alive-try-867960.framer.app/](https://alive-try-867960.framer.app/)    \n###    \n### Next Steps:   \nWe will continue building open-source tools for everyone to use. Coordinate builders in the community to build towards application experiences and tools both for and independent of the app. We also need to build a basis for an engineering environment to create a better process for a whole community of developers to contribute/co-build with us.   \n### More planned native features for an app experience:   \n- A social system with feeds, posts, etc.   \n- Improve event modules and implement additions i.e. side-events, ticketing, improve user experience.   \n- Expand on Community Spaces that can be customized with different native modules like events, messaging, and posts.   \n- Coordinate builders to hack features needed and integrate with exsiting projects to be in the Zuzalu Tech Stack.   \n   \n##    \n## Build with us!   \nWe eagerly await enthusiastic members to join forces with existing community builders, and contribute and take on challenges together. Here are at least three ways to get involved:   \n1. Co-build Shape the OS and build tools.   \n2. Module/Plug-in/Extension Integrate tools into the toolkit.   \n3.

We believe trusting communities need to be enabled by trusting technologies built to enable sharing and transparency.\n    ![04_Social Infra](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1gS2Tx_A.png)\n\n  \n\nWith the support of these communities, we have begun our product iterations journey of "Build within communities".\n\n\n\n- Shanghaiwoo 2023  [https://sola.day/event/shanhaiwoo?tab=past](https://sola.day/event/shanhaiwoo?tab=past)\n- ZuSocial [https://app.sola.day/event/zusocial?tab=past](https://app.sola.day/event/zusocial?tab=past)\n- MuChiangMai [https://themu.sola.day/?tab=past](https://themu.sola.day/?tab=past)\n- Wamotopia [https://sola.day/event/wamotopia?tab=past](https://sola.day/event/wamotopia?tab=past)\n\n\n\n### Q1-Q2 Project Update\n\nWe brought Social Layer to many pop up cities in 2023.\n- Zanzalu [https://sola.day/event/zanzalu?tab=past](https://sola.day/event/zanzalu?tab=past)\n- Muaccra [https://sola.day/event/themu?tab=past](https://sola.day/event/themu?tab=past)\n- Vitalia [https://sola.day/event/vitalia](https://sola.day/event/vitalia)\n- Edge Esmeralda [https://sola.day/event/edgeesmeralda](https://sola.day/event/edgeesmeralda)\n\n![05_Cases](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJKe3RgdA.jpg)\n\n\n\nHere is a list of tools and integrations we supported:\n(https://app.sola.day)\n\n- Group calendar\n- Group map\n- Badge system\n- 3rd party ticketing & DID integration\n- Social profile\n- Community dashboard\n- DID system (Zupass)\n- Community token (∈dges)\n- Gamification design (ShanhaiWoo)\n\n![featurelistpng](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r15Lf1bdA.png)\n\n![community dashboard](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJsrXkZ_A.png)\n\n![zupass](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyOkfJWuC.jpg)\n\n![Integration](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1jcgyZuR.png)\n\n![06_Gamification](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJivyJWuA.png)\n\n\n### **Features:**\n\n- **Trust and Connection**: Our platform fosters both bonding ties within communities and bridging ties between diverse groups. We utilize a web of trust system powered by social tokens and badges, enabling users to build and carry their social reputation across different communities.\n- **Real-World Application**: With successful implementations in Zuzalu-inspired pop-up cities like Edge Esmeralda, Vitalia, ZuConnect, ShanhaiWoo, Zanzalu, Wamotopia, we demonstrate the versatility and impact of our infrastructure. We have been actively integrating community feedbacks at these events, iterating our design by building deep relationships with our users.\n- **Modular Infrastructure**: We provide a comprehensive framework that includes identity management, community coordination tools, event organization, and social credentialing. This ensures seamless integration and scalability for any community model.\n- **Data Portability and Ownership**: Individuals retain control over their data, ensuring portability and ownership, which is critical in maintaining privacy and fostering trust in a decentralized ecosystem.\n- **Open Source Protocols:** We built tools and protocols that are all open source, we are actively creating autonomous pipelines for more collaborators to contribute together to Social Layer.\n\n### **Next Steps:**\n\n- **Native Ticketing with USDT**\n    \n    Integrating ticketing with USDT natively on the Social Layer app.\n    \n- **Q3-Q4 2024 Pop-up Cities & Unconferences**\n    \n    Bringing Social Layer to more pop-up cities and unconferences, such as Crecimiento, Gathering of Tribes, Builder Monastery, Edge City Lanna, Devcon side events, Zulandia, Zuindia and more on the way…\n    \n- **Composable & Opensource App**\n    \n    Turning Social Layer into a composable & opensource app for easier access to community events and a better UX experience, curate deeper integration with other projects of the Zuzalu ecosystem.\n    \n- **CitizenHub**\n    \n    A place for Social Layer users to track events they went to, keep consistent information, have easier access & application process to future events, integrate with other DID services.\n    \n\n### Support Us\n\nWe are beyond excited to bring our project to a wider audience and further our collaboration and integration with the Zuzalu ecosystem.',

                "Community-run DeSci Fellowships focused on the production of open sourced DeSci tooling. \n\nMuseMatrix runs six month long fellowships; helping educate, fund and coordinate builders interested in advancing decentralised science. We take a pragmatic approach focused on tangible outputs, namely open sourced DeSci tooling. We run cohorts of approximately 20 fellows (a mix of scientists, web3 developers, ZK, AI and more) who work collaboratively to build out a product. It is designed in an additive way that scientists & developers can participate whilst also having other commitments.\n\nWe are already running one cohort and have learnings to improve how we deliver it for future cohorts. See below for updates since our previous gitcoin round.\n\n**Update Since Round #1:**\n\n[Link](https://explorer.gitcoin.co/?utm_source=grants.gitcoin.co&utm_medium=internal_link&utm_campaign=gg19&utm_content=independent-rounds#/round/10/0xd875fa07bedce182377ee54488f08f017cb163d4/0xd875fa07bedce182377ee54488f08f017cb163d4-14) to the previous round project for more details on the structure of the Fellowship\n\nThanks to your support in Round #1 we launched and completed Phase 1 of the MuseMatrix Fellowship program. \n\nFor context, the Fellowship is a six-month programme where by the end we have an economically sustainable DeSci product. \n\nIt is broken into three Phases:\n\n1. Phase 1: Teaching\n2. Phase 2: Project Scoping/User Interviews\n3. Phase 3: Project Buildout\n\nCohort 1 is currently in Phase 2\n\n**Phase 1 Recap**\n\n**March**\nWe went live with applications at the end of March. It was officially launched at the DeSci London conference on 23/24 March.\n\n**April**\nThe majority of April was spent promoting the Fellowship and we are happy to report we received almost 100 applications, far more than we expected! \n\n**May**\nThe last week of April and the beginning of May were spent interviewing potential applicants and the cohort officially kicked off at the end of May.\n\n**June/July**\nCohort 1 began with 25 amazing fellows who have now been fully DeSci-pilled! The majority (80%) had not used a wallet before nor had any prior knowledge of blockchain, web3 or DeSci. \n\nHalf of the fellows participated in person weekly at a partner office in London, while the other half were remotely connected. We had frequent syncs where the in-person cohort met the remote cohort (please see the July Zuzalu newsletter for a picture :) )\n\nThe weekly sessions involved peer-to-peer learning about science, blockchain, and DeSci subtopics. See [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g-dLfha0Q3N9Kcj2tTQfgLaVlTj7N3Ar_MY-_0yFVS8/edit#heading=h.wx2jkmylp1g3) for the curriculum with links to the Fellows presentations. \n\nWe have also kicked off the Product and Marketing working groups, covering the basics of building out a product, doing validation before actually writing code and the basics of marketing. The marketing squad promoted an open call for ideas on [Twitter](https://x.com/DeSciMic/status/1803132501222891726) which was the most-viewed episode of The DeSci Mic! We will be kicking off the Developer, Business and Article writing squads next week. \n\n**Phase 2**\n\nFellows are moving into phase 2 (as of July 15th), where they will spend 2 to 3 weeks conducting user interviews (with scientists, universities, and biotech companies) to fully scope out our main project idea (Causality Network) which is a DePIN protocol to authenticate scientific data.  \n\nAdditionally, we will productise the peer-to-peer learning element to make it easier to run further cohorts (this will be built on EAS). See [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1r8yflS8kES3E7dC_ML1iJZuRwdsLvsPmEF3YAPWwlEg/edit?usp=sharing) for details. This will be built out over August.\n\nTwo of the fellows were keen to work on an idea they came up with by themselves to which MuseMatrix will be giving support. \n\nDuring this phase, one viable project idea is for a Decentralised Pandemic Defence system which we will also be supporting\n\n**Next Steps: **\n\n**Phase 3:**\nPhase 3 is focused on project build out. We are focused on tangible outputs which we define as products or research papers. The first Fellowship group ends in October so this is the deadline to have a product live by. \n\n\n**Cohort 2:**\nWe are also running additional an cohort (in LATAM and Africa) starting at the end of this month, July 2024. \n\n**Building DeSci Products is hard!!!**\n\nDespite DeSci being three years old, there are very few live products (the bulk of the ecosystem is BioDAOs focused on funding whereas our focus is on tech products). In the entire ecosystem, there are just a handful of products that are live (most of which are in beta). DeSci products take alot of time and effort to effectively build out.  **This is why our Github repo is still empty.** We want to make something that solves real problems in science. This required us spending the first two months educating scientists/developers about DeSci to allow for effective cross-pollination of ideas. ",

This aligns with AyaLab's mission to empower Web3 builders and grow the ecosystem.\n\n3. Borderless Access: Zuzalu aims to foster a global, borderless community of innovators, researchers, and technologists. This vision of inclusive, worldwide collaboration resonates with AyaLab's goal of connecting African on-chain builders to global opportunities.\n\nIn this way, AyaLab aims to be a valuable contributor to the Zuzalu ecosystem, helping to onboard the next billion users onto the blockchain through the work of talented African on-chain builders.",

                "# The emergence of Carbonvote 2.0\n\nCarbonvote.com's 2024 upgrade intends for it to be utilized in the Ethereum community, serving as a platform for gauging community sentiment on proposals related to the Ethereum network and as a tool that can be used for similar purposes in other community affairs. \n\nThis platform allows users to vote on issues offering a space for decentralized decision-making.\n\n## Background:\n\n[Carbonvote.com](https://beta.carbonvote.com) was a website built across several teams in the Ethereum Community. It facilitated a signaling mechanism for Ethereum stakeholders to express their preferences on important decisions. In the context of the DAO attack, it was used to conduct a carbon vote, a type of vote in which participants indicate their preferences by casting a certain amount of votes proportional to their stake in the network.\n\n[Carbonvote.com](https://beta.carbonvote.com) played a role in the aftermath of the 2016 Ethereum DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) attack. As a response to the attack, one proposed solution was a fork in the Ethereum blockchain, which would roll back the transactions associated with the DAO attack. This proposal led to a significant debate within the Ethereum community. (See [Repo](https://github.com/consenlabs/carbonvote))\n\nEthereum stakeholders were asked to vote on whether they supported the implementation of a hard fork to reverse the effects of the DAO attack. The carbon vote on carbonvote.com showed that a significant majority of the community supported the hard fork option.\n\nThe name “Carbonvote” is composed of two elements: “Carbon” and “vote”. In this context, “Carbon” symbolizes something fundamental and elemental. Just like Carbonvote is a fundamental governance tool in the Ethereum community it provides the functionality of poll voting and counting for big community decisions.\n\n## Objective & Carbonvote V2.0:\n\nThe DAO incident and the subsequent hard fork highlighted the challenges and complexities inherent in decentralized governance, with divergent perspectives within the community on how to address critical issues. For this upgrade, beta.carbonvote.com needs to address some known issues found in the previous implementation.\n\nAs the Ethereum community continues to evolve, there is a recognition of the need for improved signaling mechanisms and platforms like Carbonvote.com to facilitate community input on proposed upgrades and changes. The development of effective and inclusive tools for signaling and decision-making remains a priority for fostering consensus and maintaining the decentralized nature of the Ethereum network.\n\nTo address the goal of going beyond Zuzalu and creating advanced signaling tools for the Ethereum community, especially in the context of discussing potential hard forks, it’s important to consider the specific needs and concerns of core developers. The aim is to provide a platform that not only facilitates community input but also ensures the legitimacy of proposals, instilling confidence in core developers.\n\n## Key Features \n\nCarbonVote is a platform that enables the creation of polls, with real-time display of results. It supports two types of polls: EthHolding and HeadCounting.\n\n### A. Voting Methods:\n\n#### A.1 EthHolding Method:\n\n- Utilizes smart contracts for on-chain voting.\n- Dynamically calculates ETH held by each voting address.\n- Voters cast zero-valued ballots to specific addresses, determining Yes or No based on the transaction destination.\n- Real-time display of total ETH voted for each option during the voting process.\n\n#### A.2 HeadCounting Method:\n\n- Each voter's vote has equal weight.\n- Results displayed in real-time.\n- Introduces a Credentials system.\n\n### B. Current Features: Credential Checking System\n\n#### B.1 Credential Types:\n\n- Zupass Credential (Zuzalu Ticket Holders, Zuconnect Ticket Holders, Devconnect Ticket Holders):\n  - Requires holding specific Zupass tickets for voting.\n  - Integrates well with Zupass for authentication.\n- Gitcoin Passport Credential:\n  - Requires an authenticated Gitcoin passport with a score above zero for voting (test version).\n  - Allows customization of score thresholds in future releases.\n- Ethereum Events POAPS Credential:\n  - Requires a user's wallet to have a certain number of Ethereum events POAPS for voting.\n  - Verification methods include API and smart contract.\n- Protocol Guild Membership Credential:\n  - Corresponds to the HeadCounting method that each vote has the same weight.\n  - Requires the user's address to be on the list of protocol guild members, verified using a smart contract which is similar to EthHolding poll.\n\n### C. Upcoming Features:\n\n#### C.1 Usage of Secret Message:\n\n- Allows users to prove ownership of an account by sending a transaction with a locally-generated secret message, providing an optimized method for user verification.\n\n#### C.2 Changes in Storage:\n\n- Shifts all polls to Web 3.0 stacks, making polling data transparent and aligning with the vision of CarbonVote becoming a dApp.\n\n#### C.3 Poll Counting for Different Groups:\n\n- Allows polls to be open to multiple credential groups.\n- Counts votes of each group individually, providing a better reflection of diverse views.\n- Supports overlapping credentials within groups.\n\n#### C.4 Optimized Storage Methods:\n\n- Explores cost-effective ways of storing and deploying polls while preserving validation possibilities.\n- Considers methods such as off-chain signatures and storing on IPFS.\n\n## Build with us!\n\nExplore Carbonvote 2.0 - Now Open for Testing! 🚀\n\nWe're excited to announce that Carbonvote 2.0 is now open for testing! Dive into the beta version and experience the latest features at [beta.carbonvote.com](https://beta.carbonvote.com/). Your feedback is invaluable as we strive to enhance and refine the platform.\n\nJoin the Zuzalu Community Toolkit Server! 🏆\n\nFor collaborative discussions, insights, and the exchange of expertise, we invite you to join the Zuzalu Community Toolkit Server.

                "ZK Email is a set of open source SDKs, libraries, and protocols (https://prove.email) that support making anonymous proofs of redacted existing emails on chain. This is useful for provenant proofs, by directly verifying SHA-RSA signatures from your emails within ZK. It can be used for proof of twitter account, proof of github contribution, and to make KYCs on Airbnb/Coinbase etc portable -- all of which have open source prototypes now, without centralized attesters (see prove.email for links). Our code, roadmap, and ideas are fully open source at https://github.com/zkemail.\n\nWe finished and are currently auditing https://github.com/zkemail/ether-email-auth, which lets any developer specify how they want to parse a subject in Solidity, and use that to build a new zk-email enabled app on-chain in 10 lines of Solidity.\n\nWe used this to build account recovery modules for wallets, which is live for Gnosis Safes at prove.email/recovery , which allows anyone to add an email address as a decentralized guardian for their wallets. We discussed this at ZK Summit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZTNzvLXB14 .\n\nWe also built email wallet (demo: https://emailwallet.org, docs: http://docs.emailwallet.org) as an open standard and protocol that anyone can plug into -- it allows you to use your email as a wallet signer, allowing much easier onboarding onto Ethereum. The first version of this tech was actually created at Zuzalu! In addition, plaintext emails serve as a one-click replacement for hot wallets, for signing and sending transactions. It also lets anyone send any NFT directly to any email address. We also released 2 factor authentication via email signers on Safes using emailwallet.org (https://prove.email/blog/2fa) and general email-login based authentication modules via email wallet (https://zkemail.gitbook.io/zk-email/login-with-zk-email-oauth-api).\n\nWe think this is the future of provenant identity proofs on Ethereum, as well as the future of simple wallet interfaces to onboard new people to crypto via emails.\n\nWe rely only on pre-existing cryptography and our bespoke, highly optimized ZK proofs to verify your mailserver's signatures -- there is no centralized computation, MPCs, trusted hardware, or attestations. Only trust smart contracts, email, and DNS infrastructure.\n\nNote that the primary developers on the project are funded by grants from Ethereum Foundation's Privacy and Scaling Explorations group, and initial development was funded by 0xPARC. Gitcoin money will go towards hiring developers to contribute, travel expenses for folks working on the project, and funding hackathon prizes to encourage folks to build atop the protocol, as these are not included in our primary grants.\n\nUPDATE July 2024:\n\nThanks to your support on Gitcoin, we were able to achieve a number of key goals. With that money, we built and hosted registry.prove.email, which is a public key archive of 1M+ DKIM public keys. We were also able to fund development https://registry-dev.zkregex.com/, which is a beta version of a tool that lets you construct a new zk email proof by just specifying a 10 line JSON configuration with your regex details (docs at https://zkemail.gitbook.io/zk-email/zk-email-sdk). We were also able to fund travel of one of our developers to Brussels for EthCC, in order for him to build at the hackathon and strategize with the team. We spent a previous Gitcoin grant on infrastructure development for our relayer.\n\nThe work is entirely open source. Previous work has led to a number of impactful open source contributions in the zk space including:\n\n- The first RSA-SHA256 circuit in halo2\n\n- The first ZK Regex circuits and libraries, in circom and halo2: https://github.com/zkemail/zk-regex\n\n- Halo2 Benchmarking: We have open sourced a halo2 wasm benchmarking repo that runs any halo2 wasm code in the browser on 100 instances in parallel for any browser on any operating system (mobile or desktop), and spits out the mean running time and variance -- we intend to publish this as an easy to use Cargo and NPM package soon for others to use.\n\n- Halo2 Optimizations: We have various halo2 circuits to split verifiers, divide circuits for faster parallel client side proving, and many others. We have in addition contributed back to various open source libraries in the ecosystem.\n\n- Educational content: We have created a set of blog posts (https://prove.email/blog), talks, and docs (https://prove.email/docs) around our experiences, including generic ZK breakdowns, benchmarks, and explainers such as https://prove.email/blog/zk .\n\n- Circom Hash to Curve on the Grumpkin Curve: Our circuits enable proving the private set intersection (PSI) protocol in ZK, which we use for decentralized relayer communication, so that relayers cannot censor unfavorable queries.",

This new class of NFT can streamline recognition and the redemption of corporate sponsored perks of increasing value, based on easily verifiable NFT tiers - visible at a glance, and **provable on-chain for those who wish to verify**. This enables transparency, motivates generosity, and strengthens ties between individuals, brands, and causes.\n\n- **Over 110 of these prototype NFTs have already been [minted](https://opensea.io/collection/proof-of-philanthropy)** by public-goods supporters and **tracking Zuzalu-related and longevity-related donations**, with further integrations planned **with Hypercerts, Gitcoin, BetterGiving,  and Endaoment**.\n\n  \n\n[![Proof of Philanthropy Ouroboros Example](https://pop.lifespan.io/static/media/welcome.6c9aecb1.gif)](https://pop.lifespan.io "Proof of Philanthropy NFT Prototype Minting Service")\n\n---\n\nHaving such an **easy to understand and utilize tool** to unify the public goods regenerative space has **been long-desired by the Gitcoin and Zuzalu community**. Furthermore, such a system **facilitates donations** to the verified initiatives tracked by the Proof of Philanthropy protocol in a **credibly neutral** manner, the importance of which blockchain technology pioneers such as **Vitalik Buterin** have  highlighted:\n\n> “**If there was a strong, effective, and credibly neutral pot - where you just know that if you throw money into the pot public goods projects and people behind them will be compensated in way that is reasonably fair - that’s something that lots of people would be willing to automatically airdrop to.**”\n\n  \n\n**[![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/rJZZCGuKNBr2GU2-2SohcX-5a1hbFRP9Bng6QZ7QQFP_g0mET4F-AvD8EKQQnLX_eiaspgI4yfBar_sTgUF1LOMFE5Yemsg0oKkgaHaK0AGfZ767Z9rEWWS2qdDILb1-JVMJRIMJUaxnbjY0FB4ySoU)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3dPShZwag&t=845s)**\n\n  \n\n## Open Source Technology to Support Public Goods\n\n  \n\nAs Vitalik notes, it is incredibly important for such initiatives to be conducted in an open and transparent manner, and we are committed to seeing that the modern giving pledge is one founded on digital innovation, platform neutrality, and [open source code](https://github.com/lifespanio/proof-of-philanthropy).\n\n- **We are working with Gitcoin, the Hypercerts Foundation, BetterGiving, Endaoment** and other organizations in the **ReFi community** to build on this to **create new public goods [funding models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LBPQ2lytjo&t=97)**. For example - variations of quadradic funding suited to specific scenarios (such as **Inverse Quadratic Funding**, or IQF), and the **"Ouroboros" endowment mechanism** - originally presented at [Zuzalu](https://www.lifespan.io/news/highlights-from-the-longevity-biotech-conference-in-zuzalu/) and described in detail at our [2023 Longevity and DeSci Summit](https://www.lifespan.io/ending-age-related-diseases-2023/):\n\n[![Proof of Philanthropy Data Sources and Perk Provider Examples](https://www.lifespan.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/POP_ExampleFlowchart-scaled.jpg)](https://pop.lifespan.io "Proof of Philanthropy NFT Prototype Minting Service")\n\nIf you’d like a **deep dive on how this underlying technology works**, you can watch the below video from Omar ElNagger of Weavechain, who worked with the well-known charity [Lifespan.io](http://lifespan.io/) to build the Proof of Philanthropy prototype on Polygon - based on the [blueprints](https://www.keithcomito.com/p/demi-soulbound-nfts-and-proof-of) of Lifespan’s president and technology [inventor](https://patents.google.com/?inventor=keith+comito&scholar&oq=keith+comito) - Keith Comito:\n\n**[![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/cpDcg98ZcPVrXcUpzsdOByArLSknK1byaUGNVYybpxzfP0w7PjEgOvcQvirMwwhNFgESw5DTjY7CEYM_fln_ylNMPncfB2kBbTO6YSm4aeWnXtqukpi1UiNDuRIngCfQmSw9YVUAp3tLQFAxB5pfu9M)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX7QSRU6omc)**\n\n  \n\n## The Goals of Proof of Philanthropy:\n\n  -   Create a unified system for tracking charitable giving and support of public goods-focused ecosystems such as Zuzalu: enabling philanthropic attribution, accountability, and innovative campaign mechanisms\n\n    \n-   Align incentives to reward donors: on-board blockchain and corporate perk providers\n    \n-   Expand from on-chain donation tracking: track and reward all on and off-chain philanthropic activity\n\n- Create positive-sum interactions with other public goods attestation mechanisms like Hypercerts\n\n  \n  \n\n\n[**We Already Have A Demo You Can Test!**](https://pop.lifespan.io/)\n\n**By simply donating to this campaign**  you can see Proof of Philanthropy in action! After donating (or before!), [Mint your NFT](https://pop.lifespan.io/), and with as little as $10, **you can see it power up** and  [evolve](https://opensea.io/collection/proof-of-philanthropy) based on artwork by  Gitcoin community member  [Colton Orr](https://twitter.com/mettahead).

                "Impact Garden is a platform in which contributors (projects or individuals) are able to register their contributions and have them reviewed by those who have benefitted from them. These projects, their individual contributions and the reviews they receive are stored onchain through attestations (EAS).\n\nOn the platform, people are able to not only leave their feedback for the contributors and projects to improve their work, but also for others to discover tools or contributions they might enjoy, and for funders to identify which of them should be funded. \n\nMoreover, we are able to surface and highlight the standing of the reviewers of the contributions based on their role within the community by leveraging their onchain identities.\n\nSo far we have been developing this project for governance contributions in web3 ecosystems (such as Optimism) but over the last months and after talking with other members of the Zuzalu Community and ZuVillage organizers we've identified there is a big need and opportunity for us to support community contributions on the platform as well specially as funding from third party sources becomes available, such as Optimism's RetroPGF3. \n\nThrough this round we aim to start researching and prototyping the work required to integrate with Zupass and Agora.city for identity and the interface for ZuVillages.\n\n",

                "NeuroFusion is developing open-source tools for collecting health, behavior, and brain activity data in community settings. Our aim is to create predictive models for cognitive decline and mental health symptoms.\n\nWe began with a [mobile app](https://usefusion.ai) that helps users manage changes in productivity, physical and mental health using personalized prompts. Our [web interface](https://usefusion.ai/research) allows users to record activity data during tasks and validated cognitive experiments. This data is then analyzed to reveal variations in brain activity.\n\t\nWe have since introduced [Quests](https://usefusion.ai/blog/quests), enabling distributed data collection around areas of interest and shared results. We believe that this is a critical piece of infrastructure required to accelerate progress in neurotech & decentralized science.\n\n![Quest Onboarding](https://res.cloudinary.com/og-tech/image/upload/ar_16:9,c_fill,e_sharpen,fl_progressive,g_auto,w_1000/v1721224697/PHOTO-2024-06-06-04-51-33_gdmpgv.jpg)\n\n## Principles\n- Privacy: Local first & user's are anonymous by default. People & not platforms should own their data.\n- Ease of use: Bringing research into people’s daily lives means we have to lower the barrier to entry. You do not need to have a 'science' background to use our tools.\n- Interoperability: Anyone can export their data for analysis and even use our schemas for building their own apps.\n- Working with our doors open: We welcome anyone interested to use our [open source](https://github.com/neurofusioninc) code or reach out to us for collaboration!\n\n## How far along are we?\n- Launched [mobile app](https://usefusion.ai) on Android and iOS for behavior tracking, integrated with Apple Health and Google Fit. Provides personalized summaries from data and actionable suggestions to navigate daily activities.\n- [Web platform](https://usefusion.ai/research) with mobile EEG device integrations for anyone to run cognitive tasks and longitudinal studies. \n- We’re releasing [open datasets](https://huggingface.co/neurofusion) for people to build on: resting state EEG, cold plunges & brain activity, task-based data correlated with brain activity (e.g., screen time combined with EEG to understand neural correlates of context switching).\n- Validation & Feedback at pop-up cities: investigating the [effects of coldplunges at ZuConnect](https://usefusion.ai/blog/cold-plunge-impact), understanding cognitive workload during chess at Edge Esmeralda\n\n![NeuroFusion EEG/Chess - Edge Esmeralda](https://res.cloudinary.com/og-tech/image/upload/ar_1:1,c_fill,fl_advanced_downscale.progressive,g_auto,w_1000/v1721224716/IMG_9807_uip4ne.jpg)\n\n![topograph](https://res.cloudinary.com/og-tech/image/upload/v1721226715/Screenshot_2024-07-17_at_7.31.31_AM_u0iwqv.png)\n\n\n## Roadmap\n- Use NeuroFusion’s tools for group studies with communities around areas of interest - validating interventions, investigating neural dynamics during task processing!\n- Allowing anyone do brain recordings on their mobile phone with automatic analysis afterwards\n- Support for [closed loop experiments](https://github.com/NEUROFUSIONInc/fusion/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+interactive) – being able to make decisions based on changes in people’s brain waves. e.g playing music based on your brainwaves to elicit certain brain states.\n- Developing a foundational model for brain activity that can easily generalize to a new person.

Here’s how to get involved:\n- Give feedback on active features in development\n- Join our network of research participants, [link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1xYHSMapg8eqzw7No13qdAMTYdvW4d4EECW5XUKZcs0k/edit).\n- Come [write code with us!](https://github.com/NEUROFUSIONInc/fusion/issues)\n",

                "Introduction\n\nVitalia is building a decentralized city for biotech acceleration. Vitalia’s first hub is in a special jurisdiction with pro-crypto and pro-technology laws. Vitalia uses crypto to overcome a big problem: access to finance for real-world infrastructure (e.g., clinics, labs, residential). To solve this problem, Vitalia is building a protocol that allows crypto crowdfunding and tokenization / collateralization of real-world assets against which to borrow money. \n\nThe Beta Test\n\nWe want to fund a Human Enhancement Clinic (HEC) with a lunarpunk aesthetic for the first project. We are looking for funding from the Gitcoin round to tackle the following (in order of priority):\n\n- Create and deploy the smart contract necessary to be the backbone of this. We expect to use a simple ERC-20 contract with some slight modifications to make this viable\n\n- The token for the HEC will launch with a conversion rate of 1 USD per token and an initial sale of 70% of tokens towards funding the project, 10% to reward project contributors, and 20% belonging to a treasury\n\nMonetization For Contributors\n\n- Yearly revenue from the rental pool: Once a year, token holders can claim USDC, corresponding to money received from the rent of the physical spaces. We are expecting a 10%—15% APR on rental space\n\n- Claim USDC when a direct sale is made: when a direct sale is made, token holders can claim a percentage of the sale corresponding to the number of tokens they are holding\n\nWhy Vitalia?\n\nVitalia is positioned as a great executor for this project because:\n\n- We operate in a Special Economic Zone (SEZ), which allows us to write our own regulations regarding the blockchain's integration of real-world assets, and it would seamlessly API-integrate with their official property title registry\n\n- The SEZ has its own arbitration center, which can provide additional security to token holders that their investments are safe\n\n- We have strategic partnerships with Ixian, a law firm specializing in Web3 and Legal Engineering; BioFoundry, which is already tokenizing other kinds of assets inside the zone; and a world-class real estate development company that will start operations inside the zone.\n\n- We have a high demand for commercial and lab spaces from entrepreneurs working in biotech who want to provide services through medical tourism here or run early-stage clinical trials inside the zone, which ensures a good APR from regulatory arbitrage.\n\n- As the SEZ grows through additional projects, the land will become increasingly valuable, ensuring a great ROI if the spaces inside the building or the project itself are sold \n\n- Vitalia has an extensive investor network willing to invest via token or traditional means to ensure the project's success\n\nUse of Funds\n\nWe are going to allocate the funding received through the Gitcoin round to accelerate progress on the project by:\n\n- Developing an open-source legal framework for tokenizing real-world assets that anyone interested in replicating our model could use.\n\n- Developing a Smart Contract that fulfills the needs of tokenizing real-world assets, including the mechanisms for supporters to get their APR and ROI in case of a sale.\n\n- Develop the construction plans for the laboratory, which will serve as the beta test.\n",

              description:
                "Communities have used lotteries to raise funds for their treasuries, public goods, and/or specific causes (charity) for multiple centuries - even millennia - all around the world. Legend has it that the Great Wall of China was funded that way. Augustus Ceasar used them to repair the city of Rome. Lotteries were used to kickstart Harvard and Yale... Aside from the popular (but monopolised) “national lotteries”, many cultures in different continents have similar micro-scale methods to fund clubs and public goods. Some examples are Lotería Familiar (Dominican Republic), Arisan (Indonesia), Chit Fund (India), Esusu (Nigeria), Tontine (France), El Gordo (Spain), etc... However, these lotteries can be rigged and nontransparent, which breaks the community's trust and collaborative efforts.\n\nOverall, lotteries have been a very interesting coordination mechanism to form capital for public goods. Their major flaws (transparency, fairness, optionality) can be solved by building a permissionless protocol on Ethereum that allows anybody to create their own lotteries. To achieve this, we are using our novel EVM-optimised cryptographic shuffling tech (previously used at Fairy Raffles, and derived from a 2018 repo by Vitalik), which enables gas-efficient, fair & fully onchain lotteries and raffles. Additionally, our team is also developing next-gen verifiable sources of randomness for networks that don’t yet have one.\n\nLottoPGF's goal is to add a capital formation mechanism to the PGF toolbox that anybody can use to incentivise people to donate to their preferred project. For this, we have created a factory that makes it as easy and customisable as possible for organisers to create a fundraising lottery with the following customisable parameters: The ticket price, the split between the prize pool and contribution pool per ticket, the prize draw date, and time OR interval (if rolling lottery), percentage to roll over in case of jackpot win (if rolling lottery), and the chances of winning (range of numbers to be picked).\n\nOnce deployed, the player/donor can buy lottery tickets from an easy-to-use interface to support their preferred network state, event, community, or cause.",

                '**TL;DR:** dTrials is a hardware and software stack for distributed to fully decentralized clinical trials.\n \n# Vision\nIn an era where technology is reshaping healthcare, our team proposes an innovative approach to revolutionize clinical trials. Our vision is to create a new paradigm in clinical trials - one that is more inclusive, equitable, and efficient. By decentralizing the research process and employing innovative technologies, we strive to open up new avenues for scientific discovery and healthcare advancements, making clinical research accessible to all.\n \n# Issue Statement\nOur project addresses several pivotal challenges in clinical trials:\n\n- Data Accessibility and Utilization: Real-world health data is often trapped in isolated silos, impeding its use in health innovation and research due to organizational, legal, and technical barriers.\n\n- Participant Engagement and Compliance: Low engagement and compliance in clinical trials result in incomplete or biased data.\n\n- Trial Accessibility: Traditional trials face geographical and logistical barriers that restrict diverse population participation.\n\n- Data Privacy Concerns: Convincing participants to share personal health data remains a significant hurdle due to privacy concerns.\n\nBy introducing a decentralized model for clinical trials and enabling direct data sharing from individuals, we aim to enhance data collection efficiency, improve participant engagement, and foster more inclusive and diverse research.\n \n# Solution\nOur proposed solution integrates advanced technology and a decentralized approach to address key challenges in clinical trials. It encompasses:\n\n- Advanced Technology Integration: Utilizing MCS Data Labs\' proprietary smartwatches equipped with sensors for comprehensive bio and environmental data collection, supported by custom software and AI/XAI algorithms for efficient data capture and processing.\n\n- Decentralized Clinical Trials Infrastructure: Creating an open-source platform to democratize the research process, allowing diverse groups to conduct their own clinical trials.\n\n- Privacy and Data Sovereignty: Incorporating Web3 technologies like sharding and ZK proofs to ensure enhanced privacy and data security, giving users complete control over their data.\n\n- Tokenomics for Participant Compliance: Introducing a tokenomics model to incentivize participants through smart contracts, promoting adherence to trial protocols.\n\n- Community-Driven Research Ecosystem: Implementing a DAO structure to allow community members, including patients and researchers, to actively participate in the research process, fostering a democratic, privacy-preserving approach.\n \n# Background\nOur journey began at the ZuHack event in Istanbul last November, where we focused on enhancing the privacy aspects of our technology and conducted a small-scale pilot with MCS’s proprietary smart devices. Our innovative approach won two awards in the DeSci and ZK categories, validating our initial hypotheses and setting the foundation for our ongoing work. \n\nMore details on our submission can be found on the [DoraHacks project page](https://dorahacks.io/buidl/7963) and on [our repository from that hack](https://github.com/dTrials/zuhack23).\n \n\n\n** Please explain how your project meets the round-specific eligibility criteria.**\n\nBoth founders attended ZuConnect Istanbul and one co-founder attended Montenegro. Both of us are substantial decision-makers for the tech project.\n**Other sources of funding**\nWe have received 0,82 ETH from HackZuzalu’s prize money and 2.564 ETH from the last Gitcoin QF1 round.\n\n\n**Past Achievements**\n\nWe have participated in the previous QF round and used the received funds for hardware and software development. We have developed the architectural framework and are working on the private and public key signing feature on the device, ensuring captured data is verified and tamper-proof.

                "# TL;DR\n\nAt its core, a Soulbound Expedition is an experience where a small group of people embarks on an intentional journey of self-discovery, with a clear start and finish, and with an opt-in digital record from both their collective and individual perspectives, measuring and visualizing both the sum of the journey and its peak moments.\n\n# First Dive\n\nThe overall goal of our upcoming pilot projects is for Kosmostasis Labs (that’s our r&d lab!) to research novel ways of understanding flow states and coexistence among all life forms, and we are pushing forward by hosting experiences that are both meaningful and tech-driven as a means to continuously iterate on our technology.\n\nEach Soulbound Expedition leverages a diverse array of tools from IoT, web3, and AI, along with practices such as journaling, meditation, and circling, to capture unique biomarkers, which help us understand personal growth and progress toward achieving peak performance.\n\nMost of our development so far has happened IRL (process over code) and the open-source stack we are starting to develop is rooted in practices you might’ve heard about, like [neural annealing](https://qri.org/blog/neural-annealing), ludology, Campbell’s hero’s journey, and spiral dynamics, among others. We envision rabbit holes like creating digital organizations based on real-life experiences, and a game engine may surface as we continue our experiments.\n\n# Soulbound Expeditions x Zu, a word by [@Kosmostasis](https://t.me/kosmostasis)\n\nThe concept of this technology has been floating around my mind for a couple of years.  It consolidated after I managed to destroy a Fitbit during a six am cold plunge in Kotor Bay while running a small test on myself during a long celebration at Zu in Montenegro. At Zu in Istanbul, I convinced my friend Celin to test some ideas using her company’s clinical research device, the SmarKo. We won a couple of accolades at ZuHack and our research has since expanded, with her focused on the health aspects and my personal research focusing on experiential settings, interoperability with other wearables/attestations, and neural annealing.\n\n![LIOS Labs' Desert Transformation Lab](https://www.goethe.de/resources/files/jpg1297/5_oasis2021-formatkey-jpg-w983.jpg)\n\nEarlier this month, I spent 11 days camping in the Błędowska Desert in Poland at [LIOS Labs’ Desert Transformation Lab](https://experience.lios.io/) (hosted by a Zu Montenegro attendee) where I ran another experiment capturing my vital signs while also capturing the humidity and temperature of the desert environment. While the tech isn’t fully ready yet, we are now confident to start running more ambitious experiments alongside Zu-themed events where participants can meaningfully spend time in nature while pondering and shaping the future of coexistence.\n\n# Roadmap Draft\n\nLate July\n\n- New SmarKo devices ready\n- Small test in Venezuela (pending availability)\n\nAugust – September (smol batch pilots with prototype devices)\n\n- Test during ZuVillage (TBC)\n- Test during Zuiterland\n- Test during ZuBled (TBC)\n- Brand & Community Development\n- Work/code on mintable (bio) moments platform\n\nOctober – November\n\n- Community-signal-driven pilots in Asia (with more devices/participants)\n\nDecember – January\n\n- Soft launch at Ayllu alongside a Soulbound Expedition to Mount Roraima\n\n---\n\n**Find us [@soulboundexpeditions](https://t.me/soulboundexpeditions)**",

The conception of this project has revolved around making what is happening in popup communities legible and creating useful artifacts, like wikis, afterward.

                "TinyCloud is a multi-phase project designed to help individuals manage and own their AI data. We are seeking funding for the first of three planned phases, focusing on our flagship application, AutoGraph.\n\nAt its core, TinyCloud turns unstructured conversations into actionable knowledge, enhancing decision-making and collaboration across various organizational settings. AutoGraph, the centerpiece of our first phase, is a tool for generating knowledge graphs from unstructured data. Its initial application, demonstrated at Edge Esmeralda's demo day as the *\"Edge Esmeralda Digest & Wiki,\"* showcases how TinyCloud brings structure and insight to information generated in group settings.\n\nHere's how the **Community Wiki tool** works:\n\n1. Community members record audio from sessions and upload it to the system.\n2. AutoGraph processes this data to generate a wiki and digest of ongoing events.\n3. Participants can then stay informed about relevant activities, people, and concepts they want to engage with.\n\nThe impact TinyCloud aims to have is multifaceted:\n\n1. Improve understanding and connectivity in popup communities by making events more 'legible' to participants.\n2. Create valuable, long-lasting digital artifacts for communities. This graph should be particularly meaningful for participants.\n\nBy using Zupass, this wiki becomes a protected community asset, further enhancing its value.\n\nSubsequent phases for TinyCloud will explore AI pendants and develop a protocol for user-controlled data, expanding individuals' ability to manage their data used by AI and AI Agents. This is an important goal for TinyCloud, but is outside the scope of the grant.",

                "> The Hypercerts Foundation pioneers open-source protocols to transparently fund and reward positive impact. Hypercerts are the web3 tools track impactful work, evaluate it and sell its impact.\n\n# Where are we headed\nImagine a world where positive impact was one of the most highly valued creations in our society; where entrepreneurs who pursued high-uncertainty, high-upside moonshots to radically improve society were rewarded directly for that impact; where becoming a patron of impactful causes was something people aspired to and displayed proudly; and where the methods used to evaluate impact were credible, transparent, and independently verifiable. \n\nThat world might seem a distance away, but it’s one we can build towards. Specifically we’d like to see more impact markets, retroactive funding and innovation in the way we fund public goods. In order for this to occur, we need protocols to track and fund impact.\n\n# What are hypercerts? \nA single hypercert is a semi-fungible token that accounts for work that’s intended to be impactful, and whose ownership can be fractionalized and even transferred under specific conditions. Each hypercert represents a unique impact claim capturing the following basic information:\n- Who: Set of contributors\n- What: Scope of work\n- When: Time of work\n\n\n## Avoiding silos – interconnected funding system\nAs an extension of ERC 1155 semi-fungible tokens, hypercerts create a single, open, shared, and decentralized database for funding mechanisms. This database avoids the creation of new funding silos, as hypercerts can be integrated into any existing funding platform, thereby creating an interconnected funding ecosystem.\n\n## Selling impact – moving beyond donation\nWhile hypercerts may be useful for any funding mechanism, they’re particularly valuable for retroactive funding as they provide baseline invariant guarantees that impact claims will not be forgotten. Projects create and sell impact, building financially sustainable and scalable revenue models. With hypercerts, we move beyond donations.\n\n## Certifying impact – open evaluation system\nCertifying impact is a process, and it should be an open and dynamic one. Hence, with hypercerts we create the foundation for an open evaluation system for credible and transparent impact assessment. Every hypercert can receive multiple evaluations from different evaluators using a variety of methodologies. This creates incentives to innovate evaluation methodologies and builds trust.\n\n# Where do we go from here\nLooking ahead, we aim to expand to more chains, enable evaluations with existing and new tools, enhance visualization with hyperboards, create marketplace tools, and collaborate for broader integration. With your support and a growing network, we're building a transparent interconnected funding ecosystem for positive impact.\n\n# The work so far\n- We released our whitepaper (draft): https://hypercerts.org/docs/whitepaper/whitepaper-intro \n- We have build the core protocol and released it on Optimism, Celo, Base as well as Sepolia (testnet)\n- We have build out the marketplace functionalities to buy and sell hypercerts\n- We have created the evaluation infrastructure for hypercerts based on EAS attestations\n- We have created a frontend for anyone to create hypercerts – available at https://www.hypercerts.org/ --> A new release will be available in mid to end of July\n- We have build an SDK for anyone to build on top of the protocol: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hypercerts-org/sdk \n- We have piloted hypercerts with the last three Gitcoin Rounds (Alpha, Beta, GR18) to show how they can be integrated into funding platforms – you can read more about it here: https://go.gitcoin.co/blog/hypercerts-for-public-goods-funding \n- We have piloted hypercerts with the pop-up city Zuzalu, retroactively raising 21 ETH and ZuConnect Istanbul raising 16 ETH for contributors to these events\n- We have created hyperboards to visualize the contributions from multiple hypercerts to a project and piloted this with the conference series Funding the Commons as well as the libp2p community\n- We have a core community (TG group: https://t.me/+YF9AYb6zCv1mNDJi) with many projects and platforms exploring how to use hypercerts\n- We ran a Gitcoin Community Round with 35 projects in the Hypercerts Ecosystem: https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/retrospective-of-the-hypercerts-ecosystem-round-during-gg20/18908\n\n# The work ahead\n- Release the core protocol on additional EVM-compatible chains\n- Enable further evaluations and supplementary information for specific impact domains\n- Build out hyperboards, such that any project and event can create them directly\n- Implement hypercerts for use cases, specifically AI Safety Research, Nature Regeneration, Events and Open Source Software\n- Cooperate with funding platforms and projects to integrate hypercerts and build new applications like prize competitions with hypercerts\n\n# Testimonials \n\nJuan Benet (founder and CEO of Protocol Labs):\n> We are proud to be an early supporter of the Hypercerts Foundation, which will bring even greater focus and resources to this important area of innovation. The Hypercerts Foundation is helping build a more transparent and interoperable environment for funding public goods. We are excited to contribute to its mission in any way we can.\n\nKevin Owocki:\n> This is an exciting moment for the Hypercerts Foundation and for the future of impact funding. We are committed to advancing the development of decentralized protocols and novel coordination mechanisms.\n\n[See the announcement of the Hypercerts Foundation](https://hypercerts.notion.site/Introducing-the-Hypercerts-Foundation-d956203fe0fc4792980da138015e770a)",

                "**ZuGarden is a 3-week immersive Zuzalu-style pop-up village in Thailand from November 10th till 30th by the creators of ZuBerlin** 🌱 \n\nWe'll bridge the gap between focused **in-depth research** discussions (Ethereum, safe AI advancement, decentralized governance, public good funding, etc.) and **genuine human connection** in a co-created community-atmosphere. We'll provide space to explore with curiosity and expand your comfort zone, as well as to relax and get to know other fascinating and special humans on a **deep personal level**. ❤️\n\nA special focus of ZuGarden will be to **explore and immerse ourselves in Thai culture**. Usually, conferences go straight from the hotel to the conference center. That’s sad. We want to be different and are partnering with locals to let our curiosity discover the best of Thailand. 👘🤗\n\nAfter ZuBerlin, participants said they were “stretched and made uncomfortable in the best possible way” and called ZuBerlin “a turning point in [their] life”. At the same time, it was an important shelling point for advancing Ethereum’s protocol by reaching actual new insights and deploying a novel Ethereum testnet for preconfirmations. 🚀 We strive to create a similar experience at ZuGarden. 💥😍\n\nHere you can find an album with some impressions from ZuBerlin: https://link.zuberlin.city/impressions-2024 📸\n\n*Let's bring that vibe to Thailand. Are you curious? ✨🌱*\n\n# 📆 Dates:\nZuGarden will start just before Devcon in Thailand (Greater Bangkok Area) and will run for 3 weeks from **November 10th to November 30th**. There will be a strong recommendation (but no obligation) for people to participate for at least 2 weeks. As with ZuBerlin, we'll be putting together a very well-balanced group to create an inspiring community, learn from each other, and grow together.\n\n# 👥 Team:\nThe team consists of experienced event organizers and founders, including the ZuBerlin core team and local team members connecting us with the local communities in Thailand.\nChris Haug: https://x.com/cshg0x\nPascal Stichler: https://x.com/pascalstichler\nMarc Nitzsche: https://www.marcnitzsche.de/\nJantine Derksen: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jantinederksen/\nEniko Garam: https://x.com/eniko_g\nOlly Kovalieva: https://www.linkedin.com/in/olly-kovalieva-40a23450/\nNichanan Kesonpat: https://x.com/nichanank\nPam Sangchotchaungchai: https://www.linkedin.com/in/tatnita-sangchotchaungchai-1312a1100\n\n# 🗒️ Schedule and co-creation:\nThe schedule will balance thoughtful programming and unscripted interactions. We are planning clear kick-offs and onboarding to get to know the group and a lot of unstructured free time to exchange with peers, build social connections and a contextual frame to co-create the agenda together.\n\n# ⚙️ Our main themes and tracks:\n1. Mechanism Design and Incentive Structures\n2. Applied Cryptography and Scaling of Decentralized Systems\n3. Artificial Intelligence and Autonomous Agents\n4. Governance and Public Good Funding\n5. Immersive Experiences and the Human Factor\n6. Exploration of Thai and Asian Culture\n\nWe are beyond excited to have many people from the community and broader ecosystem join us in November for ZuGarden as the next iteration after ZuBerlin! 🌱🤗",

                  "The NFT landscape is still struggling to provide the new opportunities it has the potential to create. Existing NFT platforms are driven by commercial purposes, and miss the objective of providing an interoperable ecosystem for openness and creativity. Alongside this, creative practices within the NFT are yet to be perfected, often focusing mainly on speculation, and lacking the desire to rely on open and interoperable standards. To make things worse, many of NFT platforms do not provide for the proper licensing of digital assets to their participants, and instead establish terms of services that remain under the exclusive control of the platform operators. Many NFT collectors are just following the trend, eager to pump and dump digital artworks, which they can “shill” on the secondary market, in order to earn money from speculation. We need dedicated individuals to research their use cases and the ways in which blockchain and NFTs can contribute to more creativity and collaboration, how they can enact a striving economy of digital abundance, how NFT platform should be structured to become more interoperable, which standards they should adhere to, and how they should be governed so that members can be protected and engaged to participate in this new environment. \n",

                "The GLITCH art collective is organizing the fourth edition of its art residency. It’s a 3 weeks long event gathering blockchain / AI artists and engineers, collaborating on the creation of new NFT collections inspired by the notion of CC-0 and Remix. GLITCH is a unique opportunity to build new types of public goods, past editions have led to the creation of several protocols (e.g. REMIX NFT, IMPACT NFT) as well as an open source NFT Token-Bound Licensing standard to embed Creative Commons-like licensing conditions directly into NFTs.\n\nThis year, we will bring together a highly curated group of creative and smart individuals contributing towards or researching the use of blockchain and artificial intelligence in the artistic domain to produce new artworks, technical standards, philosophical concepts, research or products that tackle key societal issues. The underlying rationale of GLITCH is to push the boundaries of crypto art, i.e. to inspire artists and engineers to collaborate in order to explore the use of blockchain as a medium, rather than as a mere transaction layer.",

                "# Zuitzerland 2024\n\n## Prototyping a Swiss inspired network society\n\nBecome a pioneer resident, and part of seeding a new long-term network society experiment in the Swiss alps.\n\n![Interlaken Labs](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1008017683654119465/1263189674957082696/image.png?ex=6699548f&is=6698030f&hm=d8578e542a25daacbc3f33998345041317715691be0c9f405eee9a0357bc1576&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=1100&height=620)\n\n### Background \n\nAs Balaji and Vitalik have stated in the past, decentralised organisations don’t mean an absence of leaders, but an abundance of them. \n\nOur initial idea with Zuitzerland as outlined in our [February proposal to the Zuzalu community](https://explorer.gitcoin.co/?utm_source=grants.gitcoin.co&utm_medium=internal_link&utm_campaign=gg19&utm_content=independent-rounds#/round/10/0xf89aad3fad6c3e79ffa3ccc835620fcc7e55f919/0xf89aad3fad6c3e79ffa3ccc835620fcc7e55f919-22), was to organise an event that helped shape and accelerate a different kind of leader, one better prepared to meet the challenges of the next 30-50 years of human society:\n\nInitially we were thinking of this as a small one-off event, to take on Vitalik's challenge, and accelerate d/acc leadership.\n\n**Then in March, pure serendipity struck:** a new permanent partnership emerged with a mission-aligned friend (Next Gen Village): with the vision to transform an existing former futuristic theme park (capacity for 6'000 people) into a village of the future that serves as a living lab where the pioneer citizens can build a prototype of a regenerative future civilization.\n\n### We’re Based in a Futurist Theme Park\n\n-   We’re seeding a permanent network society at Interlaken Labs’ new village location\n\n-   Plans to renovate it into a permanent living lab and village with living pods, regenerative living, a hotel and an airstrip for electric plane / vehicle experiments\n   \n-   Interlaken Labs is set in the middle of the world heritage village Interlaken and amongst views of stunning Swiss alps and lakes, with world-class infrastructure nearby\n    \n-   Our village is just 5 minutes bike ride from the centre of Interlaken, with easy access to the two lakes, restaurants, camping grounds, hotels, hospitals, lakes and amenities\n\n## Key Info\n\nZuitzerland’s mission is to explore and iterate on viable models for d/acc leadership in network states and societies. Our community is cultivating our home, and permanent Zuvillage location, in Switzerland's beautiful Interlaken region.\n\nZuitzerland is the start of an experimental long-term Zuzalu node that has the opportunity to be the first of several permanent nodes and pioneer citizens, forming a living laboratory and experimental village in Interlaken Labs (code name for the planned new village).\n\nLearning from the Swiss model of direct democracy which for centuries has embraced decentralised governance, we’re setting out to provide a pathway to iterating on practical models for fusing techno-optimism and social stability. From Day 1, Zuitzerland aims to trial practical d/acc social systems and models of residence and citizenship, to develop lasting network societies.\n\n![Zuitzerland's concept](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1008017683654119465/1263191889545527388/image.png?ex=6699569f&is=6698051f&hm=e7a6d4e65d0cb4b458cbf7260842a5e498fb257aff38a7bcb4263cb3484258ca&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=1100&height=614)\n\nNext Gen Village is building a Living Lab for DAO governance and tokenomics, in a real-world experimental environment, building and simulating a micro-economy. Zuitzerland will become a seed society and node in this micro-economy experiment.\n\n![Building for the long-term](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1008017683654119465/1263194281250783415/image.png?ex=669958d9&is=66980759&hm=a1b2b1468aa51c125baeb0f198876fdbf9682011b14fd4b79b326c08a7c6c991&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=1842&height=1078)\n\n2024           Co-design (3-week off-site)                       \n2025           Pop-up village (2-3 month zuzalu style village)   \n2026+         Permanent Zuitzerland node in the NGV living lab village\n  \n## 2024 Plans:\n\n- 3 weeks targeting September kick-off\n- Interlaken, Switzerland\n- 100,000m2 theme park with large conference spaces\n- Minimum 50 full-time residents and co-designers\n- Heavily curated set of pioneer residents come together to discuss, design and co-create Zuitzerland's 2025 event, governance and the long-term community design\n- Accommodation coordinated together, but residents must pay own food and accommodation costs\n\n\n### 2024 Co-design Themes and Paths\n\nGrowing future-oriented leadership, prototyping a swiss-inspired network society.\n\n![2024 Co-design process](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1008017683654119465/1263191814605901834/image.png?ex=6699568d&is=6698050d&hm=807070e956546a2ff1a1bc924990294bf2857703020a1e22d12bffd16284a542&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=2160&height=964)\n\n### 2024 back-up plans / alternative scenarios\n\nWith multiple dependencies to consider, and the late timing of the Q2 round creating a Montenegro-like event in 2024 is very hard, so we’re working to deliver a fun, experimental community event, that unlocks the talents and creativity of our community to create a special space, even if it is not the polished vision we have for Zuzalu inspired events in 2025 and beyond.\n\nWe might bring the community to additional locations in Switzerland, or keep the whole 3 weeks in Interlaken. Details to be finalised together.\n \n### 2025 Plans:\n\n- Given the longer-term partnership we have planned with the Next Gen Village,  at their Interlaken Labs location, we are already drafting plans to host a longer and even more collaborative 2 month event in 2025\n\n- Our 2025 vision includes further collaboration with other Zuzalu nodes and pop-up village organisers as well as heavy involvement of Swiss organisations and cooperatives such as Lugano Plan B, InnHub La Punt, Impact Hub and many many more.\n\n- In 2025, we have the potential to host 400+ residents given size of the location\n\n\n## Existing fundraising\n\n- The value of receiving the Interlaken Labs location at no cost is around EUR 600k for the 3 weeks\n\n- Existing funding ca. 4 ETH from Q1 funding (as ZuLead)\n\n### So much room for activities\n\n-   We’re taking over 100,000m2 of conference / event infrastructure: ready to convert it into a permanent village and living labs experiment in governance, crypto economic models and regenerative living. \n-   There is A LOT of indoors space to camp and create makeshift working and sleeping areas, in a truly experimental and creative format - we can make this our own\n-   From the party pyramid - decked out for discos, to the circular AV room where we can host debates and the smaller event space in the tower, there is so much we can design, build and create here - and some things might be able to be kept permanently for our longer-term Zuitzerland node\n\n## About the Interlaken Labs space\n\n![enter image description here](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1008017683654119465/1263190614640558211/image.png?ex=6699556f&is=669803ef&hm=ebe2932a4628dcad6df2fc40a3e6632fa58cde964bae2fcd144745fd77a8dca3&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=1100&height=616)\n\n- Includes a central tower, which has three 300m2 event spaces, an office floor, and canteen area, bathrooms for visitors, and in a circular village surrounding the tower there are multiple large conference halls where contributors can host many interesting unconference experiments\n- Commercial kitchen (for which we can hire caterers to staff and provide meals for residents)\n- Parking for hundreds of vehicles / campervans / trucks / buses and (even) planes\n- There's even an airstrip next door that we can likely use to test electric planes or futuristic vehicles\n-  Depending on funding and community ideas, we are looking at bringing in additional (currently missing) infrastructure for 2024.\n\n## Next Gen Village's Plans \n\n-NGV is taking the next 3-5 years to plan and build a futuristic city and living lab with its pioneer citizens, and community nodes. In the short-term we're working with them on ensuring:\n\n- Sufficient accommodation showers and bathrooms for 100+ people to live for 6+ weeks. In 2024, people will need to stay in local hotels / hostels until this infrastructure is built)\n\n- Turning Interlaken Labs into a special place for our community - it's pretty basic for now as it was built 20-30 years ago and needs renovation \n\n- This room for improvement is also an opportunity to make it our own and design the place our community will reside.\n\n![Interlaken Labs in a few years](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1008017683654119465/1263191322811043980/image.png?ex=66995618&is=66980498&hm=7de24c42e143e17a7820a04b6688c6ca33eef7a9006e338f81ac2e9733ae395f&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=1100&height=592)\n\n![Next Gen Village Future](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1008017683654119465/1263193533880205353/image.png?ex=66995827&is=669806a7&hm=587b36fdec7e84780adc371b8886db7de0f5c289b29b34ff90d7c002112796d9&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=1100&height=612)\n\n\n### Core contributors\n\n**Kaia** - Tech @ BIEN, Economist, Community Governance Advocate\n**Alberto** - Tech..Smart contract engineer @ Curve EPFL\n**Una** - Strategy / Curation, PhD researcher @ ETH zurich, R&D @ Casper (L1 protocol), Contributor @DAOSUISSE @DAOVOZ, Zuzalian\n**Isla** - Strategy / Curation…DAO Suisse, Zuzalian, Contributor  @DAO Suisse @Auditless @UniswapFND @FTW DAO @DAOVOZ\n**Yesh** - PM, ALLFED.

                "# ZuFloripa + ETH Floripa\n\nGet ready to come to **the Island of Magic in Brazil!**\n\n## TL;DR\n\nCreate a three-week unconference in Florianópolis, an Island in Brazil to foster knowledge about Ethereum and its related topics, such as ZK, DAO governance, DeSci, and to promote human interaction, communication, and the advancement of technology in human coordination.\n\n## Description\n\nIn the first round of Zuzalu, we submitted a [**proposal related to the creation of ZuFloripa**](https://checker.gitcoin.co/public/project/show/yanomami-zufloripa), an event aimed at merging indigenous wisdom with modern decentralized governance models. We received a sum of funds are being used to kick-off the structure and advance the milestones as possible. We continue to seek additional funding to host an even larger and more comprehensive event.\n\n### **Background:**\n\nBrazil is the largest country in Latin America and South America, alongside great nations teeming with builders like Colombia, Argentina, Venezuela, and many others. However, Brazil still lacks a major gathering that aligns with Ethereum's values and can provide a comprehensive experience, from co-living and the main conference to talks and local experiences. Since 2023, ETH Samba has done an excellent job promoting hackathons and uniting the community. For this reason, we will invite them to organize the hackathon segment of ETH Floripa during ZuFloripa.\n![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1lsHaSu0.png)\n\n[https://x.com/DeFiDave22/status/1812421026669625715](https://x.com/DeFiDave22/status/1812421026669625715)\n\n**Florianópolis is the safest capital in Brazil** and boasts an **extremely strong web3 community of builders,** with nearly monthly events ranging from technical meetups to Pizza Day. The Blockful team, responsible for initiating this event, participates in various ETH conferences worldwide and has noticed a **pent-up demand for an event like this in Brazil**. Hence, we are spearheading this unique initiative with a **primary focus on governance**.\n\n**The Island of Magic will become the Island of Governance.**\n\n![Untitled](https://i.imgur.com/GKMgYVf.png)\n\n### What is ZuFloripa?\n\nA three-week unconference that will gather, on an island in Brazil known as the Island of Magic, the most relevant topics on governance, human coordination, privacy science, and ZK technology.\n\n![Untitled](https://i.imgur.com/U8EsLWq.png)\n\n### Event Agenda:\n\n**First Week:**\n\n- **Hackathon:** We will invite ETH Samba to join us in this initiative. ETH Samba has already hosted two Hackathon editions in Brazil with major partners like Chainlink, Scroll, ENS, and many others.\n- **ETH Floripa:** A conference at the beginning of February serving as the entry point for all builders, featuring talks, panels, networking, and local experiences.\n\n[Blockful team @ ETH Samba 2024 (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cP9r7aQbaw)\n\n\n**Second Week:**\n\n- **Governance Week:** A week focused on co-living spaces with human bonding experiences. It will include events in various locations with different themes, allowing everyone to participate in dynamics, discussion circles, product presentations, and governance-oriented experiences.\n    - Collective Sense-Making\n    - Reputation\n    - Human Coordination and Anthropological Knowledge\n    - AI and Governance\n    - Current State of DAO Governance\n\n![Untitled](https://i.imgur.com/Ynp5Upv.png)\n\n**Third Week:**\n\n- **ZK and Privacy:** A time for those interested in ZK and privacy to delve into these topics, including technical discussions, talks on the current state of the technology, and existing and needed use cases.\n    - Current State of the Technology\n    - ZK and Reputation\n    - Privacy as a Premise\n    \n    ![Untitled](https://i.imgur.com/oGh5i69.png)\n    \n\nDaniela and Zeugh (Blockful's Product Managers) building on Governance @ Arb GovHack 2024\n\n- **DeSci Time:** The final week of ZuFloripa will also cover DeSci, featuring presentations of scientific papers and research on longevity, women's health, and science funding through decentralized means.\n    - Ongoing Researches\n    - Science-Focused DAOs\n    - Scientific and Academic Discussions\n\n![Untitled](https://i.imgur.com/Dza1NgZ.png)\n\nOur ED talking about his experiences with the Zuzalu community @ DeSci Belgrade 2024\n\n### Why ETH Floripa | ZuFloripa?\n\nThese events bring together the shared values of Florianópolis, the Ethereum, and the Zuzalu community. Floripas' strong sense of community and innovation aligns with Ethereum's focus on collaboration and collective problem-solving. **ZuFloripa creates an environment for meaningful connections and groundbreaking initiatives.**\n\nGovernance and human coordination are key themes, featuring sessions on decentralized governance, collective decision-making, and reputation systems. The local emphasis on participatory governance complements Ethereum's decentralized models and DAOs.\n\nPrivacy and security are crucial, especially with the rise of Zero-Knowledge (ZK) technology. The city's tech community shares this commitment, making it an ideal place for in-depth discussions on governance, ZK, privacy, and science. \n\nAdditionally, Floripa's rich cultural diversity and inclusive tech scene guarantee that diverse voices and perspectives are represented at ZuFloripa, leading to richer discussions and more robust solutions.\n\n### **Project plan & Milestone:**\n\n**Design and Identity:**\n\n- Website Designer: DONE\n- Visual Identity: DONE\n\n**Prototypes and Initial Steps:**\n\n- First Prototype to Collect Interested Emails: DONE\n\n**Logistics and Venue:**\n\n- Choice of Venue: PENDING\n- Definition of Coliving Space: ONGOING\n- Choice of Dates: DONE\n\n**Sponsorship and Partnerships:**\n\n- Seek Sponsors: ONGOING\n- Zuzalu Application: ONGOING\n\n**Event Content and Experiences:**\n\n- Definition of Experiences: ONGOING\n- Definition of Key Theme: DONE\n\n**Announcements and Communication:**\n\n- First Public Announcement: COMING SOON\n\n### Milestones from the past round:\n\n**[Q2 2024]**\n\n**Visit Yanomami Tribes and Collect Insights**\n\n***Status:** The visit to the tribes was not possible due to the limited budget from the quadratic funding round. However, we have already made a presentation about the Yanomamis in the Metagov community, and the research is progressing with the support of an anthropologist.*\n\nhttps://archive.org/details/metagov-seminar-yanomami-zeugh\n\n**[Q3 2025]**\n\n**Research and Papers Release**\n\n***Status:** We conducted interviews with several anthropologists, and one has agreed to start the research in August. The Yanomami topic is quite delicate, and many anthropologists avoid addressing it. The idea is to launch the research during the event.*\n\n**[Q1 2025]**\n\n**ZuFloripa Organization**\n\n***Status:** The ETH Floripa website already has a design, and we have a tentative agenda for the event. We are finalizing the choice of the venue for ETH Floripa as well as the best neighborhood/region for the ZuFloripa co-living. Additionally, the team is working on local experiences focused on sharing knowledge and fostering human bonding.*\n\n![Untitled](https://i.imgur.com/OgheJ4T.png)\n\n### At which location will the event occur and why?\n\n*Florianópolis – Santa Catarina*\n\n1. Island Atmosphere:\n    - As an island city, Florianópolis offers a unique atmosphere characterized by stunning beaches (42), picturesque landscapes, and a laid-back coastal vibe. This setting provides an inspiring backdrop for the event.\n2. Safety and Welcoming Environment:\n    - Known for its safety and welcoming atmosphere, Florianópolis ensures a positive and enjoyable experience for participants. Its reputation as a tourist-friendly destination contributes to a sense of security.\n    - Situated in the scenic coastal region of Santa Catarina, known as \"Litoral Catarinense,\" the city offers participants opportunities for relaxation and exploration beyond the event.\n    - With more than 98 routes offering direct flights to São Paulo, Florianópolis is easily accessible.\n3. Innovation and Web3 Hub:\n    - Florianópolis has emerged as a hub for web3 innovation and technology in Brazil, making it an ideal location for hosting the event. Its growing reputation for technological advancements aligns with the forward-thinking nature of the discussions and workshops planned.\n\n![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJNMmarOA.png)\n\n[https://x.com/avsa/status/1572259073994924037](https://x.com/avsa/status/1572259073994924037)\n\n### **What innovation or value will your project bring to Zuzalu?**\n\nThis three-week conference will foster deep interactions and knowledge-sharing among participants through a combination of co-living, focused discussions, and local experiences. \n\nOur focus on governance, human coordination, privacy science, and ZK technology aligns with Zuzalu’s mission as a testing space for Ethereum-based technology and a hub for futuristic disciplines. Additionally, the inclusion of anthropological insights and the promotion of DeSci research will provide a unique perspective that bridges traditional knowledge with cutting-edge technology.\n\nZuFloripa will enrich Zuzalu by:\n\n- Providing an event for cross-pollination of ideas between diverse communities.\n- Offering a space for practical experimentation and innovation in governance and privacy.\n- Promoting interdisciplinary collaboration and learning.\n- Enhancing the global Ethereum community through meaningful cultural and technological exchanges.\n- Gathering the community in a safe island space with infrastructure and builders, making it perfect for this type of event.\n\n### Meet Blockful\n\nWe work with DAOs to increase their longevity by participating, researching and **improving governance** and protocol development. \n\n*We are passionate advocates of Ethereum ethos, and the limitless possibilities it unlocks for society, contributing with:* \n\n🌱 **Commitment to Open-Source and Public Goods**\n\nFrom the products to contributions\n\n🧑🏻‍💻 **Beyond the codes**\n\nWe care about governance, and we will work to enhance it\n\n💬 **Track record of delivering high-quality coding**\n\nFrequent communication, and collaborative work\n\n[**Click here**](https://www.notion.so/meet-blockful-485f6957ddb14a7c833d9240d393119c?pvs=21) to learn more about what we are building at ENS DAO, Shutter DAO, and our products.\n\n*Thank you, I hope to see you at ETH Floripa, enjoying the Island of Magic.*",

                  "The Lovepunks Residency didn't apply in the Q1 round. However, @Manu did apply with Blockravers for providing value to the community in Q1 and received around 14.385 ETH from the Gitcoin Matching Round. These are some of the things that were done:\n\n🧬 Vitalia\n- With the help of Vitalia.City we brought 5 Core Blockravers to co-organize events during a month.\nWe hosted Safe Spaces that brought hundreds of humans together: ・Within some of the Vitalia’s houses (open only to Vitalia’s Residents). ・At the Bitcoin Center in Roatan with hundreds of attendees (Vitalia’s Residents and Local islanders). ・Seawiches which is one of the main recreational centers in Roatan (Islanders and Vitalians were invited).\n- We also collaborated in organizing and supported gatherings hosted by DDP, Lucid State DAO and the Coordinations crew.\n- During this whole trip (1 month), we spent $2000 renting vehicles + music equipment + lights and other supplies.\n\n❄️Colorado\n- We got a city bus for a project that we called the Piratebus of Love.\n- ETHDenver organizers invited us to build our project and have entertainment at all times during the conference. During the whole week Blockravers and artist from all over the world joined us and help us paint, remove sits, build a tiki stage and decorated the bus with plants, lights and more. The artist curation was done by the IRL ART team from Denver.\n- We organized together with the Ghouls community a gathering which brought together over 400 individuals. For joining, you just needed to be vouched in by someone from the community.\n- We spent $2000 in painting the bus together with IRL ART\n- We spent $1300 in buying decoration supplies for the bus\n- We spent aprox. $4000 that hasn't been reimbursed for (generator, gasoline, music equipment, tolls/parking, tow truck, other repairs)\n- We spent $9032 in common spaces for Blockravers both Denver + Breckenridge. This was partially paid by individuals and around half ($4500) will still need to be reimbursed.\n\nApart from that, we also did events around which were not proposed in the round, but still the community was invited to apply and be part of it, they just needed to get one vouch from an existing community member:\n- ETHBerlin\n- ETHPrague\n- Edge Esmeralda\n- ETHCC Brussels\n\nIn those events, we traveled with some music equipment, rented other missing equipment (lights, speakers, subwoofers), rented spaces for hosting the community, rented vehicles to transport equipment, provided the initial drinks, snacks and other things to make the snowball rolling. Also, this still needs to be reimbursed.\n\nRegarding Kickbacks, we have never offered people kickbacks. Before the Zuzalu round existed, we have always created ephemeral groups around the world where Ethereum Events are happening, for joining those groups people have to apply and insert the transaction hash of their contribution, they also need to express what contributions in kind they will be giving and express who vouches for them. Donating doesn't guarantee entry or being part of the group.\nWe ask for this for having some form of accountability, creating a culture of giving to the community and not for giving kickbacks.\n\nThere are still funds from the Q1 round and from donations to join ephemeral groups (which doesn't have to do anything with the Gitcoin Round) which we will continue using for providing experiences through Blockravers. Experiences provided in Montenegro and Turkey were provided with our own funds and also have never been reimbursed (similar as all the events since Devcon Osaka)\n",

              description:
                '# Bloom City - JellyfishDAO Pop-Up Village\n\nBloom City is a pop-up village in LA that is bringing together longevity thought leaders, innovators, scientists, and entertainment creators to form a new society focused on catalyzing a longevity cultural revolution. By using positive entertainment and fostering organic, bottom-up collaboration, we aim to seed a movement that prioritizes extended and enhanced human life.\n\nInspired by Zuzalu\'s principles and leveraging this grant, our goal is to establish a permanent cultural space in Los Angeles, where longevity is integrated into daily life.\n\nWe will bring together 80-100 people from different skill sets and backgrounds to a massive shared space, with a single goal: create cinema to inspire humanity that an ageless world is desirable.\n\n\n## The Problem\n\n**(a) Negative portrayal of longevity in popular media:** Longevity and life-extension are often depicted negatively in popular media, particularly by Hollywood. Films and TV shows frequently portray efforts to extend life as dystopian or unnatural, leading to societal chaos and personal ruin. Examples include movies like "In Time," where immortality leads to extreme social inequality, or "The Island," which portrays life-extension through cloning as unethical and horrifying. These narratives reinforce fears and misconceptions about life-extension, overshadowing the potential benefits of longevity science.\n\n**(b) Influence of popular media on public perception:** Movies and other popular media have a profound power to shape public opinion and emotions. They can influence societal attitudes towards scientific advancements and ethical issues, often more powerfully than factual information. By consistently portraying longevity negatively, the media shapes a public narrative that life-extension is undesirable and fraught with peril. This pervasive negativity hinders the acceptance and support of longevity research, which could significantly improve quality of life and societal health.\n\n**(c) Lack of dialogue and collaboration between longevity and filmmaking communities:** Currently, there is a significant lack of ongoing dialogue between the longevity science community and the filmmaking industry. This disconnect prevents the development of positive, informed narratives that could shift public perception. A broad and continuing dialogue between these communities is essential to create content that accurately represents the benefits and ethical considerations of longevity. Such collaboration can harness the power of media to inspire and educate the public about the potential for extended, healthy life spans.\n\n## Solution\n\nJellyfishDAO has been building a development and production incubator for longevity-positive entertainment, with the goal of funding movies, documentaries, shows, and new media experiences.\n\nThis gathering will create be a physical instantiation , with an engaging environment where longevity science meets popular culture. Inspired by Zuzalu, our event will:\n\n-   **Facilitate knowledge sharing:** Host talks, panels, and workshops with experts in longevity science and entertainment.\n    \n-   **Promote healthy living:** Integrate health-focused group activities such as yoga, meditation, and nutrition workshops.\n    \n-   **Encourage collaboration:** Foster organic, bottom-up collaboration among participants through community open spaces and networking activities.\n    \n-   **Leverage positive entertainment:** Showcase films, books, and media that promote longevity and well-being, followed by discussions and panels.\n    \n-   **Sow the seeds for future creative endeavors:** By bringing together the longevity and filmmaking communities for an extended period of time, we will foster new relationships and spark ideas for media/science crossover projects, ensuring a growing and lasting impact beyond the event itself.\n    \n-   **Celebrity proximity:** Since we\'ll be in LA, the heart of Hollywood, we aim to get a celebrity for a Q&A session (even if virtual). Edward Norton is someone on our list of possibilities, and we are discussing other options.\n    \n\n## Team\n\n-   Aimee Schoof (Film Producer)\n    \n-   Mădălina Bellariu (Actor and Producer)\n    \n-   Keith Comito (President, Lifespan.io)\n    \n-   Laurence Ion (Co-creator @ VitaDAO, Vitalia & Zuzalu)\n    \n-   Tim Maupin (Film Director)\n    \n-   Daniel Sollinger (Film Producer)\n    \n-   Isen Robbins (Film Producer)\n    \n-   Guy Bahat (Web3)\n    \n-   Adam Gries (Entrepreneur)\n    \n-   Kirill Delikatnyi (Community Builder)\n    \n-   Ewan Dawson (Web3)\n    \n-   Joshua William (Marketer)\n    \n-   Erin Magennis (DeSci Community Manager)\n   \n\n## Roadmap\n\n**Phase 1: Planning and Partnerships (August - October)**\n\n-   Finalize event logistics and secure venue.\n    \n-   Establish partnerships with key stakeholders.\n    \n-   Launch marketing and outreach campaigns.\n    \n\n**Phase 2: Execution (November, December)**\n\n-   Host the event, integrating workshops, panels, and health-focused activities.\n    \n-   Facilitate organic collaboration and self-organized sessions among participants.\n    \n-   Make a mini-documentary of the event itself for promotion and gather feedback for future improvements.\n    \n\n**Phase 3: Post-Event Development (December)**\n\n-   Analyze feedback and refine the concept.\n    \n-   Establish a permanent cultural space in Los Angeles.\n    \n-   Continue to foster the community and plan follow-up events.\n    \n\n## Budget\n\n  \n\nEvent venue - $45k\n\nFood - $15k\n\nSubsidies - $15k\n\nTotal - $75k\n\n## Impact on the Zuzalu Ecosystem\n\nOur event will extend the principles of Zuzalu by creating a sustainable, long-term community focused on longevity media in LA. By fostering a permanent cultural space, we will provide a hub for continuous collaboration and innovation, amplifying the impact of the Zuzalu ecosystem. The integration of entertainment and positive messaging will broaden the reach of longevity practices, attracting diverse audiences and encouraging widespread adoption of holistic well-being practices.\n\nBy merging the fields of longevity science and entertainment, our event aims to inspire a new societal focus on extended and enhanced life spans. With the support of this Gitcoin grant, we can create a lasting impact, fostering a community that prioritizes well-being and longevity, ultimately contributing to the broader goals of the Zuzalu ecosystem.\n\n  \n\nDates: Nov 11 - Dec 2, 2024\n\n  \n\n##  Programming:\n\n### Week 1: Orientation, Connection and Foundations\n\n### Week 2: Deep Dive and Content Creation\n\n### Week 3: Spreading and Future Planning\n\n### Self-Organized Programming\n\n-   **Daily Flex Time:** Slots available each day for self-organized activities.\n    \n-   **Community Dinners:** We will have a community dinner every day. Some dinners will be free-form, others will start with a specific question or icebreaker to help attendees jump into interesting conversations.\n    \n-   **Health-focused Activities:** Distributed throughout each week to maintain participant well-being.\n    \n-   **Networking:** Regular opportunities for informal connections.\n    \n-   **Community Open Space:** We will have working groups that will meet 4 times a week. They will be open to everyone, and scheduled at different times so attendees can participate in multiple. Every group will have a facilitator to oversee each meeting, write up action items, and summarize key achievements and needs.\n    \n-   **Pitch Sessions:** Creators can pitch their movies, TV shows, and other entertainment projects in front of top investors, producers, filmmakers, celebrities\n',

                "## Major Updates\n\n- The dates will be from **November 19th to December 9th**, right after DevCon.\n    - August is simply way too hot for a coliving experience in Taiwan; we almost had heatstroke while scouting the venue in March.\n- We secured the venue - **Tainan Cultural and Creative Park**.\n    - It’s a coworking space previously rented by another tech company. They are moving out in late September, which means we will have a nicely decorated coworking space!\n    - It’s near the Tainan Train station, which is the most convenient spot in the whole city.\n    \n    ![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c1279b38-97b3-4376-8a23-44c409bc090a/602cd9dd-bcaf-46d2-98c6-d355f1d3221c/Untitled.png)\n    \n    ![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c1279b38-97b3-4376-8a23-44c409bc090a/455ba3c6-8b03-45e1-b304-b096ee153b33/Untitled.png)\n    \n- We also secured the accommodation partner - the **Tainan Association for Hostels**\n    - They already secured 120 beds for us with three price ranges:\n        - Higher class: 20 single rooms\n            - 1200 - 1500 NTD (40-50 USD) per night\n            - 25,200 - 31,500 NTD (840 - 1050 USD) for the whole stay\n        - Middle class: 50 single rooms\n            - 1000 - 1200 NTD (35 - 40 USD) per night\n            - 21,000 - 25,200 NTD (630 - 840 USD) for the whole stay\n        - Youth and Hostel: 50 beds (might be bunkbeds)\n            - 600 - 700 NTD (20 - 25 USD) per night\n            - 12,600 - 14,700 NTD (420 - 525 USD) for the whole stay\n- **Notable partners**: In the past 2 months, we have visited Tainan 3 times and met with some important local partners who would support our stay there.\n    - [Tainan Sprout](https://www.tnsprout.org/) (台南新芽): Tainan Sprout is one of the most well-known non-profits in Tainan that works on democracy and human rights. They will help us navigate the local logistics during the prep for Zulandia.\n    - National Museum of Taiwan Literature: They are the national museum in Tainan, which has a rich historical collection of literature. Many of our content will be from here. They agree to work with us as traditional knowledge and history advisors.\n    - [Tainan Bird Association](https://www.tnbird.org.tw/): They are the environmental NGO in Tainan working to preserve the birds and more. They will be our ecology advisor, inspiring us to adopt ecological thinking in the planning.\n\n## Main Focus of Zulandia\n\nWe are still trying to consolidate the focus of Zulandia, but the following are the key ideas that will soon form a narrative. \n\n### Local Connections\n\nConnecting the Zuzalu ecosystem with the local communities to understand the real use cases of crypto, decentralized governance, and more in a real-world setting. We work to connect ourselves with various organizations, communities, and institutions in Tainan, to fully integrate Zulandia in the city, instead of being isolated. Following are a few dimensions we focus on: \n\n- Democracy and Human Rights in Tainan\n- Food, beverage, and living in Tainan\n- Religious and Spiritual life in Tainan\n\nThe Zulandia experience will be more curated than other pop-up cities. We plan to develop a story to gamify the whole living experience, using the local elements as the foundation of gamification. In the following section, we will show the initial idea of gamification.\n\n### Identity as Container\n\nIdentity crisis is not new to Taiwanese people. Being colonized by many different cultures and countries, each Taiwanese has always had this mixed identity. The old generation might consider themselves Japanese. Some people consider themselves Chinese, and some Taiwanese. Ｗe have been trying to figure out what can best represent Taiwan, but realized that our rich culture comes from this lack of super-dominant identity. Taiwan is a container containing the rich wisdom of diverse cultures, which is why our democracy is so unique. \n\nAt Zulandia, we use the “Taiwan identity as a method.” Each individual will be their own container of their identity, and after fully participating in Zulandia, their unique identity will be formed. For example, if I participated in 10 events about democracy, 3 events about religious life, and 1 about food, my identity would lean more towards a “democracy activist.” Each person will gain a unique identity at the end of the event, and together, we can see how Tainan as a city shapes the people that live in it. \n\nThis is also an experiment on relational identity - your relationships with events, sceneries, people, organizations, and food shape who you are. We will adopt Social Layer as our tech layer to facilitate the develop of our identities.  Following is a simple chart of what we are planning but not the final version.",

For example, we aim to explore the role of DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) as a foundation of labor organization and/or explore introducing a digital currency called $pace. As of now, $pace is the conceptual value framework within the Masterminding Eden project, representing the volume of space available for community use, whether for homes, factories, or farms. The cost varies by location and usage, linking each $pace to a share in Masterminding Eden, ensuring community members have a vested interest in the well-being of both the city and the corporation. $pace serves as a coordination mechanism, fostering stewardship and responsibility through a blockchain-mediated system, enabling self-sovereign currency issuance and democratic governance.

                  '**Our Problems**\n\nWe, as humanity, are facing multiple urgent problems. We\'ve crossed planetary boundaries, causing ecological tipping points and cataclysmic events due to greenhouse gas emissions, pollution, deforestation, and biodiversity loss. Our current civilization system is fragile and toxic, exacerbated by short-term thinking and ignorance. \n\nOur primary challenge is transforming our civilization into one that is resilient, regenerative, and capable of reversing the current environmental damage. This transformation requires shifting from an extractive, competitive mentality to one of cooperation, resource-sharing, and ecological stewardship. We need to build an Advanced Ecological Civilization that supports all life through a regenerative economy, sustainable technologies, and a new culture rooted in unity with nature.\n\nOur real issue is not a lack of technological solutions but a coordination and implementation problem, compounded by various crises, including mental health, climate, ecological, economic, geopolitical, and more. This complex "metacrisis" calls for a collective effort to create a system that sustains the planet and humanity far into the future.\n\n**Our Team**\n\nThe Masterminding Eden team consists of 40+ experts and includes scientists, engineers, solutionist entrepreneurs, and sensemakers, serving as contributors and advisors to the project. We collectively brainstorm and ideate on the design of the 2025 Mastermind event (incl. the structure, location, tracks, collaboration systems, etc.), while also utilizing the vast high-level networks to attract the right people to support the cause. Many of our team members and core contributors are Zuzalu residents & visitors who attended for more than a week.\n\nZuzalu: Camara Cassin, Gary Sheng, Nicholas Brigham Adams, Cassie Shih, Jesse Katz, Kristof DeSpiegeleer, Deger Turan\n\nZuConnect: Gary Sheng, Timofei Dort-Golts, Cassie Shih, Jesse Katz\n\nVitalia: Timofei Dort-Golts, Jesse Katz\n\nEdge Esmeralda: Camara Cassin, Jesse Katz, Jordan Sukut, Eli Whipple, Michel Bauwens, \n\n**Our Budget**\n\nTake a look at our v1 budgeting system here:  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QYEpJiwa8jEYCYqOIh6jSLrqOZaiCmjx/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=107754540422549554837&rtpof=true&sd=true\n\nBesides QF we plan on funding the event through Access Pass Sales, Sponsorship, Grants and Donations.\n\n**Our Progress**\n\n- We have secured the venue in Tuscany, Italy as well as came up with the 50-person attendance list for the ME:Horizons event that includes core team members, prominent philanthropists, and founding supporters\n- Found new amazing contributors, bringing the core team to 40 members\n- Created online collaboration board and groups\n- Held regular meetings since Jan 2024 to align visions, plans, and specify event details\n- Formed a working group to organize the month-long event\n- Identified and reached an agreement with a value-aligned venue in Switzerland that can host 300+ people onsite\n- Developed high-level agenda, goals, attendee profiles and list\n- Started compiling a database of relevant technologies and systems\n- Created draft project descriptions and proposals\n- Developed a comprehensive v1 budgeting system for the April mastermind event\n- Secured preliminary commitment from approx. 100 attendees\n- Established collaboration with key partner organizations\n- Started our social media presence on Twitter/X and LinkedIn\n- The project has momentum with a dedicated team in place, venue identified, goals aligned, and partner groups on board. The next steps are finalizing the participant list and agenda, and preparing for the collaborative design event in the spring of 2025.\n\n**Our Impact**\n\nWe will measure the impact of our project by how many deliverables we complete from this list:\n\nMain goal: Deliver a blueprint for conceiving and operating a disaster-resilient, regenerative, sustainable city, providing a high quality of life for its residents.\n\n1.

                "*What is ME:Horizons?*\n\nMasterminding Eden: Horizons is a 3-week (21-day) collaborative event for the founding contributors and supporters of Masterminding Eden.\n\nIt will take place from December 1 to 21, 2024. We have multiple potential locations that can accommodate 50-60 people in the serene Italian countryside. \n\n*Why are we doing it?* \n\nWe are undertaking a monumental challenge. In April we are gathering 300 world experts for a mastermind. To make this a world-class event that is incredibly productive and reaches our goals we have come to the conclusion that we need to organize an earlier in-person gathering for interested contributors. Thus, Masterminding EDEN Horizons was conceived.\n\nWe sincerely believe that getting the core contributors and supporters together to co-plan the main event will make a major difference in the quality of the main city-creation mastermind. \n\n*What will Masterminding Eden Horizon's be like?*\nFor three weeks we will gather in a retreat-like environment. Participants will share unconference-style and be able to add their events to our public calendar. It will be a light-hearted, open minded, future-focused community environment.\n\n*What to expect*\n- Unconference Style Seminars\n- Scheduled Lectures and Events\n- Break-out groups working on different systems\n- Wellness activities\n- Group Discussion sessions\n- Community organized activities\n- Coherence building \n- Main mastermind design discussion sessions\n\n*What is the main Masterminding Eden event in April?*\n\nMasterminding Eden is an initiative to collaboratively design and build a conceptual model and master plan for a resilient, regenerative, and self-sustaining city. \n\nTo attain this we are bringing together people from diverse fields for a month-long pop-up mastermind taking place on March 30-April 30, 2025. Through collaboration, knowledge sharing, and project acceleration, our group aims to create a framework for future cities that supports an advanced ecological civilization.\n\nWe believe that our civilization stands at a pivotal point as technology, climate disruption, health crises and social tensions transform society in unpredictable ways. Incremental change cannot address such systemic global risks. We urgently need a fundamental redesign of the societal paradigms that govern our institutions and way of life. The time has come to collectively dream, learn, connect and forge the systemic shifts humanity needs to thrive. This gathering offers a space to create - not tweak - operating frameworks attuned to people and the planet over profits. For the future well-being of all life on Earth.\n\nWe will be facilitating the event as a combination of Ephemeral Group Process, Mastermind, and Hackathon.\n\n- Integrating physical infrastructure as well as digital, blockchain, AI and other technologies into the model\n- Creating closed-loop systems for energy, food, waste, water, resources etc.\n- Designing for disaster resilience, ecosystem restoration, and long-term sustainability\n- Exploring new models of governance, economics, social services, transportation, etc.\n- Utilizing advanced simulation software to test different scenarios\n\nResidents will be provided with transportation, accommodation, three delicious meals a day, and plenty of intellectual and social stimulation. Our team is putting special emphasis on community building and coherence. Residents will also have time in their schedule to self-organize thematic or wellness events, as well as keep up on remote work. Our residents will be from all over the world. Our principles are to create systems that help all of humanity and life on Earth.\n\nSome participants stay the whole time, some come and go, and some never come, but participate online. There is learning and education, and everyone is contributing/working toward a common goal creating a solid feeling of community and camaraderie.\n\nThe core team consists of scientists, engineers, architects, entrepreneurs, sensemakers, and other leaders spanning fields like renewable energy, agriculture, technology, design, artificial Intelligence, policy, finance, and more. \n\nWe are collaborating with existing projects and organizations including:\n\n- [Lionsberg Alliance](https://www.lionsberg.org/)\n- [The Venus Project Evolution](https://www.thevenusproject.com/scenarios/venus-evolution/)\n- [HubTropolis](https://hubtropolis.com/)\n- [The Auravana Project](https://auravana.org/)\n- [Earthwise Center](https://www.earthwise.global/)\n- [HyphaDAO](https://hypha.earth/)\n- [Threefold Internet Tech](https://threefold.io/).\n- [Blue Dot Project](https://www.bluedotproject.com/about-us/)\n- [New Earth Developments](https://www.newearthdevelopment.org/)\n- [Nested Ventures](https://www.nestedventures.com/)\n- [Goodly Labs](https://www.goodlylabs.org/)\n- [Ecorestoration Alliance](https://www.ecorestorationalliance.org/)\n- [RegenEarth Studio](https://www.regenearth.studio/)\n- [The AI Objectives Institute](https://ai.objectives.institute/)\n- [Shala](https://shala.us/)\n- [REGENiTECH](https://regenitech.earth/)\n- [HackHumanity](http://www.hackhumanity.com/)\n- [RegenWorld](http://www.regenweek.com/)\n\nOur experiment will not only include digital and social technologies but also combine them with physical infrastructure.\n\nWe are inviting attendees from all systems including, but not limited to:\n\n- Urban Planning and Architecture\n- Renewable Energy and Engineering\n- Water Management\n- Food Systems and Regenerative Agriculture\n- Resource Management, Recycling, and Manufacturing\n- Transportation and Mobility\n- AI, Robotics, and Smart City Solutions\n- Blockchain Technology, and Digital Self-Governance\n- Circular Economics, Regenerative Finance, and Legal\n- Health, Education, and Social Services\n- Environmental Science, Climate Resilience and Ecosystem Restoration\n- Indigenous Wisdom, Art, Culture, and Community Builders\n- Innovation, Polymaths, Sensemakers\n\nThe month-long event incorporates diverse activities for participants, including:\n\n- Seminars and lectures delivered by experts\n- Interactive Q&A sessions where attendees can engage with presenters\n- Independent work time for participants to process concepts or collaborate\n- Small working groups dedicated to developing standards and documentation\n- Intimate discussion sessions in smaller groups to facilitate deeper dialogues\n- Large-scale collaborative working sessions bringing all participants together\n- Community-organized activities, such as discussions, panels, or workshops.\n- Other impactful hands-on engagements and exercises\n\nBoth scheduled sessions on the agenda and spontaneous activities emerge throughout the event.

                "**TL;DR:** Ayllu has a vision of becoming a pop-up city and coexistence experiment network for Latin America, focused on decentralized governance, network societies, and public goods, emphasizing systemic change and social impact, in partnership with diverse regional and local stakeholders and co-hosted by native Ethereum communities with the support of [Ashoka](https://ashoka.org/).\n\n🌿 Ayllu is a word in both the Quechua and Aymara languages referring to a network of families and to community in harmony with nature. This is at the core of our compromise with the Latin diaspora and its local roots in the Americas.\n\n\n# Agenda & Prompts Proposal\n\n## Week One\n\n- 🕸️ Decentralization’s Promise\n    - Asymmetric Blues | Degen Waltz | Solar Punk Meadows | Lunar Punk Affairs\n- 👹 Governance in the Age of Moloch\n    - Won't You Be My Neighbor? Or Tales of Microsolidarity | DAOs & Democracy Funeral Parade | URL/IRL ‘DAO’ Tooling | Network Societies & New Horizons\n\n## Week Two\n\n- 🌿 Sympoiesis > Autopoiesis\n    - Regeneration vs Planetary Limits | Systemic Views for Social Impact | Urban Guerrilla Musings\n- 🌌 Kosmostasis\n    - Augmented Self | Interspecies R&D | Space Exploration for Children of All Ages\n\n## Week Three\n\n- Nature Expedition\n\n\n# Dates\n\n**[DISCLAIMER]** Ayllu is initially planned to start on the second week of January with an expedition to Mount Roraima and two to three weeks of content afterward in Caracas, Venezuela. The reason for this late start is the fact that Venezuela will host elections on July 28th and is difficult to predict stability in the country during the next few months.\n\nGiven the change in the eligibility criteria, we’ve been fiercely debating with our partners the option to host one of our second edition options first, to offer an earlier alternative event rooted in the values of ayllu (community, family) and ayni (reciprocity) in September 2024 after the events in Argentina conclude. The options to be debated by the community are:\n\n![Plaza-de-armas-Cusco-City_1.jpg](https://goway-cms-files.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/production/featured_images/Plaza-de-armas-Cusco-City_1.jpg)\n\n📍Cusco, Perú with a natural retreat possibly in the Sacred Valley and/or Machu Picchu\n\n![dffbaaf696e2b6fd07f12fc07fe0ac14.jpg](https://mediaim.expedia.com/destination/2/dffbaaf696e2b6fd07f12fc07fe0ac14.jpg)\n\n📍 El Salvador, with an offsite to the Santa Ana active volcano and nearby volcanic crater lake of Coatepeque\n\nWe’ve also discussed the alternative of hosting the original event in Venezuela right after Devcon and before the Winter holidays, and this option will also be debated publicly. We subscribe to the rules of engagement and will follow the procedure to return the funds if there’s not enough interest in these alternatives.\n\n\n# Final Notes\n\nPlease find the full original proposal for the event in Venezuela in the following link alongside these updates: [https://kosmostasis.notion.site/Ayllu-3a192d624b6f48f5a3cd1976abad4877](https://www.notion.so/Ayllu-3a192d624b6f48f5a3cd1976abad4877?pvs=21) And connect with us on Telegram to catch the upcoming website launch (pending these decisions): https://t.me/ayllufam",

Every attendee will therefore “work on a science project” during their time at the event as this is not just a gathering exercise but one that is focused on tangible output. We define tangible outputs as products developed and research published. It is our job as organisers to facilitate this and allocate everyone to something that matches their skills and bandwidth (ie you don't need to have a project idea ). This can range from low effort (eg a decentralised trial using EEG data for example) to more hands-on (scoping and building out a project). You can consider the entire event as a ‘three-week science hackathon’ demonstrating what a floating city of scientists can achieve. ",

It is where science progresses. \n\nWe believe that knowledge should be free to come alive and that this best happens when people have the freedom to experiment and have access to the tools necessary to do so. \n\nOver 3 weeks this fall Castalia will be home to over 50 scientists & developers progressing science forward. It will be filled with scientific experiments, discoveries, & product developments laying the foundation for the future of science & DeSci.  \n\n***More info ⬇️***\n\n\n***Name and Inspiration***\nThe name Castalia is inspired by Hermann Hesse's novel \"The Glass Bead Game,\" where Castalia is a fictional utopian society dedicated to intellectual pursuits and the synthesis of all human knowledge. Additionally, the name references the Castalian Spring from Greek mythology, which was sacred to the Muses.\n\n***Event Overview***\nThis event will specifically not involve any typical conference-style talks or ‘tracks’ and it won't just be a “gathering” of people, while those elements are essential to the advancement and sharability of knowledge, Zuzalu-inspired events are all about experimentation and breaking new ground. Our structure and format will be unique, differing from all previous events to foster genuine innovation and collaboration focused on the advancement of science.\n\n\n***Focus and Goals***\nCastalia is focused on collaborative building and tangible output to advance science. We're planning a significant event for mid-2025 (lasting two months with approximately 300 attendees). To lay the groundwork, we will conduct a shorter, experimental event, refining our structure and methodologies. Support during this round will go towards Castalia v0.1. \n\nCastalia v0.1 will be a three-week long event with a minimum of 50 people occurring during October/November. We have identified a few prime locations, but the final location is TBD and will be based on community input in August.\n\n***Organisers***\nThe event will be organised by Bharat and Erin, along with Fellows from the MuseMatrix DeSci Fellowship. Together, we bring a wealth of experience running events (between us we have attended Zuzalu, ZuConnect, Vitalia, and Edge City and will be attending ZuGeorgia, Crecimiento and more). Bharat is the founder of DeSci London, the largest IRL DeSci community with monthly meetups and an annual conference. Erin has also helped run over 300 events including science tech events in over 18 different regions. \n\n***Key Questions and Objectives***\n\n***Attracting Scientists***\nHow can we attract more scientists, especially those unfamiliar with web3 technologies?\nStrategies to bridge the gap between traditional scientific communities and the emerging web3 space.\n\n\n***Optimising Event Structure***\nIs the current structure of having multiple “tracks” the most effective way to run events?\nDoes this format truly accelerate progress in specific domains or the concept of network states, or is it just a long conference with vibes?\n\n\n***Embedding Web3 Mechanisms***\nHow can we integrate native web3 mechanisms (such as PGF/Hypecerts) into the event's fabric?\nExploring practical applications and benefits of these technologies in real-time.\n\n\n***Measuring Success***\nThe event's success should not be gauged merely by “vibes” but by tangible outcomes.\n\n\n***Conclusion***\nCastalia aims to push the boundaries of conventional event structures and is focused on experimenting with mechanisms that allow a floating city of scientists to collaborate and tangibly advance science in new ways not possible pre-decentralisation adoption. We hope to pave the way for future pop-up cities & network state events focused on advancing a specific domain. \n",

LEVF is a nonprofit founded by Aubrey de Grey,  Aubrey will be in attendance for a series of talks and debates, discussing the state of the longevity field, its progress and bottlenecks we've yet to overcome. He will be available to meet with and advise founders and investors seeking guidance, to help them achieve maximum impact. LEVF's research director Caitlin will additionally be running a longevity 'think tank' - a series of discussions and brainstorming sessions taking aim at both scientific and non-scientific challenges which remain obstacles to achieving radical longevity, with the goal of formulating actionable plans to circumvent some of these challenges.\n\nThe crypto cities programme will be run by Fora. Fora helps founders bootstrap new cities through novel forms of property investment and ownership. Its investors include- Balaji Srinivasan (author, The Network State) and Patri Friedman (founder, Seasteading Institute + Pronomos Cap).\n \nPlease refer to this Google doc for the most up-to-date project description: https://docs.google.com/document/d/18-MJ2y5lKoEuLJwgppy98Z0JzyNoWVj6DI9-YTGvRRw/edit?usp=sharing",

                'The traditional concept of "sovereignty," once seen as a quality exclusive to nation-states, is changing. Thanks to advancements in digital technology, particularly in new decentralized technologies, we are moving towards more dynamic, inclusive, and network-driven governance models. This shift has been referred to as the emergence of Network Sovereignties, which include innovative concepts like Network States and Network Nations.\n\nThis fall, in Thailand, a group of thinkers and practitioners will convene in Thailand, for a 3weeks intensive workshop exploring how commons-based approaches can be applied to the development of Network Nations.  The workshop\'s goal is to cement a community of practice among innovative thinkers and builders who aspire to redefine sovereignty in the digital age. This workshop will be the breeding ground for a collaborative ecosystem where collective strategies are developed to prototype and implement Network Nations.\n\nParticipants will build on the learnings and insights gathered during the first edition of the Coordi-nations workshop at Zuzalu in May 2023 and the research conducted on the topic in the year since.',

Also, measuring what is being funded, how effective the funding is, what needs to be built to distribute, allocate, and govern funding, as well as evaluate impact.\n\nIn this experiment, we want to explore the effect on building community, the advantages of collaborative production, receiving feedback, conducting workshops, working with mentors, and rapidly producing products. Production that probably wouldn’t be possible working alone and remote.\n\nWhat makes the Funding the Commons Residency unique is that we focus on the human component first, prioritize creative freedom, promote a safety place, prioritize mental health, foster connections and development, promote learning, and provide a healthier and more regenerative work environment. We believe in inspiring growth, continuous education, and uphold values such as gratitude, generosity, teamwork beyond individual projects, inclusiveness, and connection.\n\nWe believe in inspiring growth, continuous education, and uphold values such as gratitude, generosity, teamwork beyond individual projects, inclusiveness, and connection.\n\nAll outcomes and innovations from the residency will be shared with the broader community, ensuring lasting impact and usability.\n\n**Objective**\n\nOver the course of the residency, our residents will find themselves in an intentional framework that supports collaboration, mentorship and innovation. Builders and hackers will unite to drive forward the evolution of public goods funding infrastructure, impact evaluators, impact certification systems, and other components of the public goods funding stack across both Web2 and Web3 applications. We place a high premium on open-source principles, ensuring that the outcomes of the residency are readily accessible and usable by the broader community. This is why we have deliberately sought out and welcomed individuals with a strong inclination for collaboration to participate in our residency program.\n\n- Themes to be explored during Funding the Commons residency:\n    - New methods and technologies to better fund the commons in Public Goods\n    - Understanding the impact and effectiveness of public goods funding\n    - Measuring what is being funded and how effective the funding is\n    - Creating what needs to be built to distribute, allocate, and govern funding, as well as evaluate impact.\n    - web3 public goods in the real world: applied use cases in the Thai context\n\n**Design**\n\nThe motto of the residency will be "Weaving Innovation for the Commons: Infusing local wisdom with global solutions leveraging Web3." Throughout the residency, we will emphasize two primary approaches: "Embracing the Destination" and "The Art of Weaving," aiming to make the Funding the Commons Residency deeply integrated with both local communities and participants.\n\n### 1. Embracing the Destination\n\n**Workshops:**\n\n- Address real-world problems in Asia with technology and traditional solutions.\n- Gain insights from local experts.\n\n**Cultural Immersion:**\n\n- Visit temples, historical sites, and craft centers.\n- Engage with local communities.\n\n**Philosophical Discussions:**\n\n- Explore traditional Asian philosophies in modern contexts.\n\n### 2. Art of Weaving Framework\n\n**Week 1: Identifying the Thread:**\n\n- Orientation and project brainstorming.\n\n**Week 2: Weaving:**\n\n- Create agendas and topics collaboratively.\n\n**Week 3: Fabrication:**\n\n- Develop action plans, finalize projects, and gather feedback.\n\n**Embodying:**\n\n- Focus on mental, physical, and spiritual health with self-practice guides.\n\n### 3. Program Features\n\n**Weekly Sprints and Lightning Talks:**\n\n- Weekly showcases to drive collaboration and momentum.\n\n**Special Workshops:**\n\n- Topics on public goods funding, blockchain technology, and community building.\n\n**Activities:**\n\n- Lightning talks\n- Deep dives\n- Self-organized sessions\n- Excursions\n- Open house\n- Showcase\n\n**Hands-on experience with Burmese refugee communities in Chiang Mai, Thailand, October**\n\n- The builder residency program at FtC is enhanced by an auxiliary real-world pilot project set to take place with Burmese refugee communities in Chiang Mai, Thailand, this October. This pilot, conducted in collaboration with blockchain startups focused on real-world applications for public goods funding in the humanitarian sector, offers a hands-on extension to the residency experience. Chiang Mai, a vital hub for NGOs aiding Burmese refugees, provides a rich learning environment for builders to engage directly with local communities and NGOs, gain insights into the challenges they face, and explore how blockchain solutions can address these issues. Throughout the residency, builders will have the unique opportunity to observe, interact, and prototype blockchain applications tailored to these real-world needs, thereby informing and inspiring their development of innovative public goods funding infrastructure.\n\n**About our main partner:** \n\n[Pagoda](https://pagoda.wtf) is a network of Asian web3/Ethereum ecosystem builders, thinkers, and leaders focused on humanitarian care across Asia.

Having had many conversations with scientists, community leaders, and policy experts, as well as visited network cities (Zuzalu) and pop-up cities (Edge Esmeralda), we believe that the need for a physical presence for fertility researchers from complementary disciplines to coordinate is more urgent than ever. \n\nInspired by the network state Prospera, we are founding research compounds in strategic world regions that are uniquely focused on women’s health and reproductive technologies.

However, there are a few essential guidelines to ensure the safety, integrity, and smooth functioning of the event:\n\n1) Event Registration: Anyone can apply to attend the event. We will review and accept participants based on their interests and how they believe they can contribute to the event experience. After approval, sll attendees must complete the registration process, which includes providing basic information and agreeing to the event’s code of conduct. This helps us maintain a secure environment for all participants.\n\n2) Code of Conduct: Adherence to a code of conduct is mandatory. This includes respectful behavior, non-discrimination, and following health and safety guidelines. The code of conduct ensures a safe and inclusive environment for everyone.\n\n3) Orientation Session: All attendees are required to attend an orientation session & opening ceremony. This session provides essential information about the event layout, schedule, and safety procedures. It also provides an opportunitiy for participants to meet one another and integrate smoothly into the community.\n\n4) Community Engagement: While specific activities and sessions are optional, participants will be encouraged to engage with the community. This can include joining discussion groups, contributing to workshops, or participating in wellness activities. Active engagement helps in building a cohesive and vibrant community.\n\n5) Tech: Residents will be heavily encouraged to have a crypto wallet and utilize crypto payments. They will need to share their email and use Zupass to access events.\n\nWhile ZuThailand maintains essential guidelines for safety and integrity, we firmly uphold the principle of no forced attendance. Participants are free to choose which sessions and activities to attend, and they can "vote with their feet" by opting into only those parts of the event that interest them. Dedicated spaces and times are provided for participants to self-organize events and workshops. The schedule is designed to allow for organic input and permissionless participation.\n',

                'Project Description\nZuThailand is a 6-week activation focused on Ethereum, Consumer Crypto applications, ZKP Cryptography, and Wellness. We aim to create a dynamic environment for 300 core residents across two key phases: November 7-17th in Bangkok around DevCon week, and November 18th-December 18 in Pattaya, in collaboration with Wonderfruit.\n\nDefinitions:\nWonderfruit: A four-day festival hosted in Pattaya, Thailand from December 12-16th, celebrating music, art, food, and ideas with a focus on sustainability and community.\n\nTentative Program Schedule:\nNovember 7th-17th: ZuThailand @ DevCon (Bangkok)\n- ZuThai Ban (meaning “house” in Thai), a central location for resident onboarding, co-working, and events hosted in collaboration with ZuThailand partners (i.e. unique dining experiences paid for in crypto, coffee paid for on-chain in crypto)  \n\nNovember 18th - December 18th: ZuThailand @ Pattaya \nKey infrastructure will include accommodations, daily breakfast, access to sauna/cold plunge/gym facilities, and 2 temporary pop-up structures on-site which act as a co-working and multi-functional space, with capacity for 300 guests. \n- Wellness Week (Nov 18-24): Co-created with Wonderfruit team, this week will have various decompression exercises, yoga sessions, cooking classes, and daily rituals focused on longevity + wellness\n-  Buildathon (Nov 25-Dec 18): Residents will be hacking on different tech tracks. One key track will be "Build for Wonderfruit", where we incubate and test projects with applicable use cases at Wonderfruit festival.\n- Partnership with Wonderfruit: Residents will have the option of redeeming complimentary tickets to Wonderfruit (Dec 12-16th). At Wonderfruit, ZuThailand will have a permanent buildout to host talks, panels, workshops, tech demos, and interactive sessions for educational purposes.  ZuThailand team will host creative activities at Wonderfruit to make crypto mainstream.\n\nWhat else to expect?\n- Cocreation as inspired by Zuzalu Montenegro. Residents will also be able to self-organize events within a dedicated time and space. The schedule will allow input in a permissionless way. \n- Crypto Payment Integration. In collaboration with wallet infrastructure providers (i.e. Coinbase/ Kinto, etc), we will enable all residents to pay for goods & services on site. \n- Weekend Excursions. Best kept as a secret :)\n\nCore Team:\n- Nicole Sun\n- Maggie Chen\n- Wing Vasiksiri\n\nWhat we will spend money on:\n- Venue -- accommodations, F&B, programming space in Bangkok & Pattaya \n- Shuttle service between Bangkok <> Pattaya <> The Fields of Wonderfruit\n- Merit-based sponsorships\n- Temporary pop-up buildings for programming & co-working spaces in Pattaya \n- Permanent home for Zuzalu at Wonderfruit (“The Zoo”) for project demos, workshops, presentations, and more. The Fields are not operational year round, instead, it creates pop up experiences with recycled structures annually.\n- Free daily breakfast for all residents \n- Team salaries\n\nFunding Sources: \nNote: We are non-profit and aim to re-invest all funds into future experiences\n- We intend to raise external sponsorships from protocol partners interested in co-creating experiences & products with us, for a dedicated room block for their team.\n- We also intend to sell individual resident tickets to attendees via an application process. \n\n\n\n',

              description:
                '\n# Transnational Techno-Optimist Cypherpunk Network Initiative\n\nWe are coming together to lay the foundations for a transnational techno-optimist cypherpunk network.\n\n## Potential Future Direction of Zuzalu\n\n"What is the future direction of Zuzalu?" was the central question at Zuzalu 2023. Later that year, as Zuzalu was called a "new culture," we began to consider a more specific, yet still open question: "What would be the most magnificent use case for a new culture, originating out of Zuzalu?"\n\nFor six weeks, we are running a techno-societal experiment inspired by Zuzalu, with ambitions to – this event concept itself is our attempt to answer both of these questions. Our goals are to:\n- Provide better circumstances for intellectual cross-pollination and rational discourse.\n- Decrease the dependency on trust in centralized authorities in our community.\n- Collaboratively work on tools, concepts, and a potential game plan for the future of Zuzalu.\n\n## Neutral Stance and Guiding Principles\n\nAs experiment initiators, we take a neutral stance wherever possible and intentionally avoid any terminology of "core organizer" to prevent arbitrary hierarchy from clouding the experiment. However, we are not neutral on a handful of key aspects: \n- Cypherpunk and defensive acceleration as philosophical guiding principles.\n- The importance of protecting and enhancing individual cognitive sovereignty as a prerequisite for all else on a community level.\n\nThese principles inform the technology we are using and building to operate our ZuVillage and the unconference design of the programming itself.\n\n## Mitigating Group Pitfalls\n\nWe contend that group pitfalls are inevitable in a project like this, yet can be mitigated through:\n- Careful filtering of applicants.\n- Individual education on cognitive biases and methods of rationality for all attendees.\n- A culture of critique for all presentations and discussions.\n\nThe ZuVillager application asks potential participants to think critically about the core topics of our experiment: individual sovereignty, defensive acceleration of technology, and cypherpunk philosophy, along with an example of a belief that has been updated within the last 1-2 years. We do not search for specific answers to any of our questions, but rather that an applicant puts in an effort to think and express their thoughts – a reflection of how they are likely to engage as a ZuVillager. Despite feedback that some applicants may not go through the effort to fill out a long application, we consider effort a key filtering mechanism and would rather optimize for quality than quantity.\n\n## Shared Intellectual Foundation\n\nTo equip ZuVillagers with a shared intellectual foundation, our pre-programming for the weeks leading up to the start of the experiment and our entire first week are focused on:\n- Rationality.\n- Metarationality.\n- Cognitive sovereignty.\n- Collective sense making.\n\nWe will also incorporate gears-level discussions into all subsequent programming and seek to establish truth seeking as a prerequisite expectation for scientific and technological discussions. We will encourage long-form written discussion on our ZK-gated discussion forum before, during, and after our experiment.\n\n## Embracing Early Technologies\n\nA community that values privacy, decentralization, and open source software is willing to overcome the friction of using early technologies that align with our values. A long-term crypto city experiment enables a unique critical mass of willing and technically-adept users to prove functional possibilities of emerging technologies, and our experiment is designed for this purpose. We are working closely with the Zuzalu.city software infrastructure project to provide use cases and accelerate development through hackathons and building together during our ZuVillage.\n\n## Providing Infrastructure\n\nOur focus is on providing the physical and digital infrastructure necessary for the experiment to flourish, and our experimental goal is for data to be gained for the community, for projects, and for individuals that can be carried on for future iterations.\n\n## Central Questions\n\nCentral questions to collectively elaborate answers to about ZuVillage Georgia may be:\n\n- "How can we build a digital infrastructure to integrate the cognitive and digital sovereignty of individuals, with collective intentions towards autonomy?"\n- "How can we scale into a decentralized network of seamlessly interoperable communities?"\n- "Which maps and tools are available or buildable for that, and what are their implications on different use-cases?"\n\nThis is the direction we aim to let the experiment unfold.',

Our community is keen to test out prototypes and give feedback, which is critical to helping beat the cold start problem for novel ideas. For example, we have seen how well-designed events like Zuzalu Montenegro and ZuConnect can incubate emerging technology like Programmable Cryptography and PCDS through community adoption, support, and development of products like Zupass.‍\n\n\nAdvance Governance and Community Models\nWe will demonstrate new models for community living. The innovation playgrounds are in-real-life laboratories for new decision-making and organizational models, allowing us to try innovative governance and community designs.\n",

              description:
                "\n**Zu-Grama** (pronounced Zu-Graa-muh, meaning village in Sanskrit) is a pop-up village experiment designed to address three fundamental challenges in India: **Ambition, Talent, and Capital**—each playing a significant role in fostering an innovation culture. Current efforts to tackle these challenges have been thwarted by systemic inefficiencies, symbolized by Moloch, due to their game-theoretic nature. Zu-Grama will be a mechanism designed to change the existing incentive structures and overcome these inefficiencies by exploring alternative approaches.\n\nInspired by the Zuzalu model, Zu-Grama is an India-focused effort to advance Zuzalu’s mission and build upon its foundation. Zu-Grama will unite diverse fields of technology and communities for the first time in India in a co-living setup. The pop-up village will be activated in Bangalore, India from late October to early December. The focus will be on emerging technologies such as AI, BioTech, Nanotech, Neurotech, Spacetech, Longevity, Blockchain & Crypto (with a focus on Ethereum), and communities like rationality and social impact groups.\n\nThis confluence aims to foster cross-pollination of ideas and address the challenges of ambition, talent, and capital in each of those fields. Zu-Grama will be the playground for innovation around these challenges and play a new game rather than conforming to existing paradigms.\n\nWe think of Zu-Grama as a **mechanism design**, which we will try to keep credibly neutral, with the following components:\n\n### Inputs:\n- **Talent**: Experts, builders, thinkers, and doers.\n- **Capital**: Financial, time, and social resources.\n- **Ideas**: The memetic energy of communities and problem sets.\n\n### Processes:\n- **Learning Tracks**: Structured pathways for skill and knowledge development.\n- **Residency and Community Building**: Intentional design to foster cross-pollination of ideas and build meaningful personal relationships.\n- **Funding Mechanisms**: Quadratic funding, value-aligned grants or pre-seed investment, and support for scalable projects.\n- **Governance Experiments**: Innovative governance models to be tested within Zu-Grama.\n- **Truth Seeking**: Truth seeking as a foundational principle within Zu-Grama.\n- **Neutrality**: Affordability, transparency, and verifiability of the mechanism, funding, etc.\n\n### Outputs:\n- **Successful Projects**: Real-world applications and successful projects in various tech fields.\n- **Cross-Pollination and Cultural Exchange**: Enabling a rich exchange of ideas and cultural values.\n- **Problem Sets for Zu-Projects**: Identifying and tackling problem sets that can be addressed by other Zu-projects/events.\n\n### Expected Outcomes\nWhile we aim to let outcomes emerge organically from the Zu-Grama experiment, we anticipate the following potential outcomes:\n- **Ambition and Innovation**: Cultivating a culture of high ambition and breakthrough innovations with a d/acc philosophy.\n- **Scaled Governance Experiments**: Models and tools that could help local governance.\n- **Value-Aligned Projects**: Nurturing startups and projects that align with core values of Zu-Grama.\n- **Inspiring Nation-State Improvements**: Through the actions of Zu-Grama.\n- **Long-Term Zu-Grama**: Establishing a self-sustaining and innovative community.\n- **Innovation**: Catapulting the immense opportunity India presents by harnessing the vast potential of India's talent and resources arbitrage to drive innovation and ecosystem growth.\n\nZu-Grama is a bold step towards transforming India's innovation landscape by aligning ambition, talent, and capital with systemic change and long-term impact.\n\nWe have more to say on the Zu-Grama experiment. Please see our lite-paper (WIP) [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AFP0QcSTNIoRE77d99rDIeXi3zGvxGCaw6ZYKjYbBCE/edit) for more details on how and why we want to do this experiment.\n\n## What problem are we trying to solve?:\n\nWe want to address the challenges of **ambition, talent, and capital** for different thought schools in India. Zu-Grama will provide a playground for understanding these challenges and solving them through a different incentive structure.\n\n\n## Team:\n\n- **Anish Mohammed**: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anishmohammed/)\n- **Kritarth Chhabra (KC)**: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kritarthchhabra/)\n- **Yeshodhara Baskaran**: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yeshodhara-baskaran-610096114/)\n\nYou can see other contributors on our lite-paper (WIP) [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AFP0QcSTNIoRE77d99rDIeXi3zGvxGCaw6ZYKjYbBCE/edit).\n\n## Roadmap:\n\n### Q3 2024:\n- Fundraising\n- Onboarding curators\n- Securing venue\n- Building partnerships\n- Launch applications\n\n### Q4 2024:\n- Zu-Grama activation\n- Writing reflections and analyzing the results of the Zu-Grama experiment\n\n### Q1 2025:\n- Ecosystem development support for identified fields such as mentorship programs and future funding\n- Fellowships for select participants until the next Zu-Grama activation\n- Smaller gatherings of Zu-Grama in other cities/towns in India\n\n## Budget:\n\nWe do not have a set budget yet, but the funds that we raise will be utilized for the following elements:\n- The fundraise will help us keep the quality of the event higher and make it more accessible to everyone.\n- Venue (including co-working spaces, event spaces) and accommodation\n- Programming and experience design\n- Healthy food for all the attendees\n- Prizes and grants for hackathons\n- Scholarships/fellowships for deserving attendees\n- Compensation for contributors and core team\n- Funds for the development of the ecosystem in various fields of technology\n\n## Impact on the Zuzalu Ecosystem:\n\n- Zu-Grama will perform unique governance experiments (discussed above and in the experiment lite paper) which can serve as data points for the broader Zuzalu ecosystem.\n- Through our unique funding mechanism experiments, we will contribute to Zuzalu public goods.\n- We will run hackathons for building public goods for the Zuzalu ecosystem.\n- We will identify and publish unique problem sets or calls for projects that the broader Zuzalu ecosystem can contribute to.\n- Zu-Grama experiment will be interoperable with the broader ecosystem and will consider partnerships with highly aligned Zu-events.",
