### Overview
The MACIQF (Quadratic Funding MACI) strategy is a component of a larger decentralized application designed to facilitate quadratic funding rounds. Quadratic funding is a democratic allocation mechanism where the amount of funds a project receives is proportional to the square of the sum of the square roots of the contributions it receives. This strategy leverages MACI (Minimal Anti-Collusion Infrastructure) to ensure vote privacy and resistance to bribery.
### Key Components
1. **MACIQFBase**: Defines the core logic for the MACIQF strategy, including recipient management, vote tallying, and fund distribution.
2. **MACIQF**: Extends MACIQFBase and integrates with MACI contracts for secure and private voting.
3. **ClonableMACIFactory**: Factory contract to deploy new MACI instances.
4. **ClonableMACI**: MACI contract for managing voting sessions.
5. **Constants and Interfaces**: Shared constants and interface definitions used across the contracts.

#Here's the revised description to fit the new diagram:
## Description
1. **Initialization and Deployment**:
    - The coordinator creates a pool with the MACIQFStrategy.
    - The MACIQFStrategy initializes with MACI parameters and deploys the MACI instance, poll, and tally contracts.
2. **Bob Adds Project**:
    - Bob registers his project through Allo.
    - The MACIQFStrategy adds Bob's project to the pool.
3. **Review Phase by Pool Manager**:
    - The pool manager reviews and approves the projects.
4. **Alice Allocates to Pool**:
    - Alice allocates funds to the pool through Allo.
    - Allo forwards the allocation to the MACIQFStrategy which signs up Alice in the MACI.
5. **Voting Phase**:
    - Alice casts her votes for the projects via the Poll contract using encrypted MACI messages.
6. **Tally Phase**:
    - The coordinator merges MACI subtrees, generates proofs, and submits them on-chain.
    - The coordinator publishes the tally hash and adds tally results in batches.
7. **Finalization Phase**:
    - The coordinator finalizes the round.
8. **Distribution Phase**:
    - The coordinator initiates fund distribution to projects via Allo.
    - The MACIQFStrategy verifies distributions in the Tally contract and then handles the distribution to the projects (e.g., to Bob).
